- **ML-Powered Classification**: Fine-tuned BERT model categorizes reviews into 16 distinct classes
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Identifies positive, negative, and neutral opinions across all feedback sources
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Real-time visualization of sentiment trends, source breakdowns, and feature-specific feedback
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Actionable summaries of what users like and areas for improvement via Gemini API
- **RAG-Driven Chatbot**: Natural language Q&A over vectorized review data using SentenceTransformer + Gemini

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture

#### Data Collection Framework
- **Multi-Source Scrapers**: Specialized modules for each data source (App Store, Play Store, Reddit, Trustpilot, Twitter)
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Django + Celery architecture for efficient task queuing and execution
- **Error Handling**: Robust retry mechanisms for failed scraping attempts
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL database optimized for review data and analysis results

#### Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies reviews as positive, negative, or neutral
- **Category Classification**: Fine-tuned BERT model sorts reviews into 16 specific categories
- **Vector Embeddings**: Transforms review text into vector representations for similarity search
- **Model Persistence**: Efficient storage and retrieval of trained models

#### AI-Powered Insights
- **Gemini API Integration**: Generates comprehensive insights about specific feedback categories
- **Structured Analysis**: Creates organized summaries of positive and negative aspects
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Tracks sentiment changes and feature performance over time
- **Fallback Handling**: Alternative text extraction when primary parsing methods fail

#### RAG-Based Chatbot
- **Vector Search**: SentenceTransformer converts queries into searchable vectors
- **Contextual Retrieval**: Finds and ranks relevant reviews based on semantic similarity
- **Context Augmentation**: Enhances AI responses with retrieved review data
- **Response Generation**: Gemini API produces human-like answers grounded in actual review data

### Frontend Architecture

#### Component Structure
- **React + TypeScript**: Modern frontend with strong typing
- **Dashboard Views**: Main analysis dashboards with sentiment trends
- **Detailed Feedback Explorer**: Deep-dive interface for individual reviews
- **Product Feedback Analysis**: Category-specific review insights
