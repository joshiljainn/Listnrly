Scores of firefighters took more than five hours to tacklethe blaze on Friday at the Chiltern Firehouse, a five-star hotel in Marylebone in central London. The streaming giant will now hold its event on Sunday night at The Twenty Two, a luxury hotel in London's Mayfair. An investigation has been launched over the fire, which led to the evacuation of 100 guests. London Fire Brigade (LFB) said no injuries were reported, but the venue will remain closed until further notice. The Bafta Film Awards are being held at London's Royal Festival Hall on Sunday. Pope selection drama Conclave leads the Bafta field with 12 nominations, followed by Emilia Pérez, The Brutalist and Anora. After the ceremony, which will be hosted by David Tennant, actors, producers, directors and others within the industry will flock to a number of afterparties being held around the capital. Baftas 2025: The nominations list in full The main Bafta afterparty will take place at the Southbank Centre. But Netflix is hosting its own party to recognise its talent.

It had planned to hold the event at the Chiltern Firehouse - a well-known celebrity hotspot which has previously hosted A-listers including Dua Lipa, Lady Gaga, Tom Cruise and Johnny Depp. This video can not be played BBC News However, the hotel's owner Andre Balazs said the venue will ""remain closed until further notice"" following Friday's fire. ""We are grateful to confirm that no one was hurt, and our guests and staff safely evacuated,"" he added. Fire crews from Euston, Soho, Paddington, West Hampstead, Kensington, Chelsea, and surrounding fire stations were deployed after first being called just before 15:00 GMT, with videos on social media showing firefighters using a crane to douse flames as they engulfed the top of the building. The fire service said the blaze started in ducting and spread from the ground floor to the roof of the four-storey hotel, and was under control by shortly after 20:00. The cause is under investigation. Located on Chiltern Street, the hotel occupies the site of a Victorian fire station built in 1889.

BBC,0.1139852273145831,Netflix chief: Emilia Pérez controversy a 'bummer',https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yvjd8nr3qo,,"Gascón has said she ""sincerely apologised to everyone who has been hurt"" A senior Netflix executive has said the discovery of historic offensive tweets by the star of Emilia Pérez ""really is a bummer"" for those connected to the film. Tweets posted by Oscar nominee Karla Sofía Gascón,mostly between 2019 and 2024,have caused significant fallout and left the film's awards campaign in disarray. The Spanish actress has ""sincerely apologised to everyone who has been hurt"" and stepped back from the film's awards campaign. In a new interview, Netflix's chief content officer Bela Bajaria said: ""I think it's really a bummer for the 100 incredibly talented people who made an amazing movie."" Speaking to The Town podcast, Bajaria continued: ""If you look at the nominations, and all of this awards love that it's received, I think it's such a bummer that it distracted from that. ""It really has kind of taken the conversation in a different way [from] this incredible movie that Jacques Audiard - who is an incredible director - has made. ""It really is a bummer for a lot of the people, like [co-stars] Zoe [Saldaña] and Selena [Gomez]. And in our awards team did an incredible campaign for that movie."" Bela Bajaria (right, with the film's star Zoe Saldaña) said Netflix did not regret buying the film The original tweets saw Gascón make comments about Islam, George Floyd, and the high level of diversity at the Oscars. After they were brought to light, Gascón said she was ""deeply sorry to those I have caused pain"", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments had been taken out of context. Asked if Netflix would change its social media vetting process for actors on its projects in the future, Bajaria replied: ""It's not really common practice for people to vet social tweets that way. ""A lot of people are reevaluating that... I do think it is raising questions for a lot of people about reevaluating that process."" She highlighted the logistical difficulties of implementing a vetting process: ""I think you also have to [ask]: Are we going to actually look at the personal social media of tens of thousand of people, every single day around the world, [given the] amount of original film and TV and co-prods that we make and licence? ""It raises a lot of questions about what that should look like."" Emilia Pérez leads the pack at this year's Oscars, with 13 nominations Bajaria added that, despite the tweets, Netflix did not regret its decision to pick up the film. ""If you ask me today, everything I know, we would still buy the movie today,"" she said. ""That movie is incredible and it's creative and it's bold - that's what you want, and it resonated with a lot of people this year."" Gascón pulled out of appearing at several awards season events after the tweets came to light, and is not scheduled to appear at the Baftas on Sunday. It is not yet clear whether she will still attend the Oscars on 2 March. In an Instagram post last week,,externalthe best actress nominee said she wanted to step back and ""let the work talk for itself"". She added she hoped her silence would ""allow the film to be appreciated for what it is, a beautiful ode to love and difference"". Her statement followed an interview the film's directorJacques Audiard gave to Deadline,,externalin which he condemned Gascón's tweets and said he was no longer in contact with her. Netflix had not publicly commented before Bajaria's interview, but the streamer had altered the film's awards campaign following the controversy. Gascón featured prominently in early promotional posters such as this one At this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters. The movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers. But the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars. Previously, Gascón featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress. But an updated FYC poster,externalreleased last week almost entirely erased Gascón, instead making her co-stars Zoe Saldaña and Selena Gomez much more prominent. ""The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gascón's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,""suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.,external Gascón (pictured on a US chat show in January) has released several statements since the tweets came to light Gascón released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts. But she alsogave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview,externalto CNN en Español. It has since come to light that Gascón took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team. The Hollywood Reporter said it had learned,externalthat the actress ""set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix"". The fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gascón, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted. Often, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse. The film's cast had previously attended events such as the Golden Globes together Gascón had been due to appear at several events in the final phase of awards season. These included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. However, the actress pulled out of appearing as the turmoil continued. And that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gascón and are only communicating through an agent. The publication also reported the streamer ""is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events"". It remains to be seen whether Gascón will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March. The ""Fab Five"" format sees five previous winners of a category pay tribute to that year's nominees Many film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called ""Fab Five"" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies. This sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize. For example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron. Traditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner. However, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gascón's performance from the stage. Despite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy. Instead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director. Gascón's co-star Zoe Saldaña is the favourite to win best supporting actress Emilia Pérez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night. It has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Saldaña. It was widely thought Saldaña would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies. After Gascón's tweets came to light, Saldaña said: ""It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group. ""I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me."" Later, Saldaña used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be ""abstract with your idea of redemption"". Oscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Saldaña can still follow through with her expected win. The film's director Jacques Audiard has also distanced himself from Gascón Meanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gascón because ""right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions"". ""Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,"" he said. ""It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sofía. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust. ""And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sofía said is inexcusable."" After his comments, Gascón posted on Instagram: ""Following Jacques' interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself."" She also reiterated her regret for her original tweets, saying that she wanted to ""sincerely apologise to everyone who has been hurt along the way"".

The new UK price for a Standard subscription without adverts, the platform's most popular plan, has risen by £2 to £12.99 a month, with other packages also increasing. A spokesperson said the hike would allow Netflix to ""continue to invest in programming and deliver more value for our members"". The streaming service reported record global subscriber numbers at the end of 2024, driven in part by its expanding sports coverage. Netflix's price increases - the first in the UK since October 2023 - will affect all subscription plans. The Standard subscription with adverts is rising by £1 to £5.99 a month, while the  most expensive Premium subscription is also increasing by £1 to £18.99 a month. The platform is also increasing the cost of its Extra Member add-ons by £1. For a Standard subscription with adverts, the fee to add an extra member will go up from £3.99 to £4.99. Meanwhile, for a Standard subscription without adverts, the fee for an extra member will rise from £4.99 to £5.99. Netflix has reflectedthe price changes on its website,external, with the new prices applying to both new and existing customers. ""We will occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can re-invest to further improve Netflix,"" the streamer said. Paolo Pescatore, a technology analyst at PP Foresight, said Netflix's subscription increases were ""widely expected"". ""The streaming business is following mainstream TV in its price rises, and we should get accustomed to them."" However, he added: ""Netflix must tread extremely carefully… there is a ceiling, a point at which consumers will become incredibly frustrated by price hikes."" Netflix is not the only platform to raise its subscription costs - streaming giants such as Disney+, Spotify, and Paramount+ also increased their prices worldwide in 2024. Netflix began enforcing a password-sharing ban in May 2023 in the UK and the US, which led to millions of new signups over the following year. The company said it finished 2024 with more than 300 million subscribers in total. It had been expected to add 9.6 million new subscribers between October and December but far surpassed that number, adding nearly 19 million subscribers in the final months of the year. Netflix says its huge increase in streamers was helped by the second series of South Korean drama Squid Game as well as the expansion of its sports coverage. The platform streamed two NFL games on Christmas Day and hosted a boxing match between influencer-turned-fighter Jake Paul and former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson. Net profit between October and December doubled from a year earlier to $1.8bn, while sales rose from $8.8bn to $10.2bn.

Cena is regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time and has achieved world champion status a joint record 16 times since joining WWE in 2001. He told cheering fans he ""could not think of a better place to start"" his goodbye, while stating his intention to ""win the Royal Rumble"" event in February. Fans were also treated to the return of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, who is a director of TKO. The Rock has previously played the villainous role of ""The Final Boss"", but on this occasion he spoke about the ""history"" of the night and, to the surprise of many, praised and embraced former rival Cody Rhodes. He then later appeared at the conclusion of the Tribal Combat Match between Roman Reigns and Solo Sikoa, embracing Reigns following his victory. The night also saw the brief return of The Undertaker at the end of the Women's World Championship match between Liv Morgan and Rhea Ripley. It was the culmination of a long-term storyline which saw Ripley win the championship. The action ended with CM Punk and Seth Rollins following up a much-praised back-and-forth promo on the final televised episode of Raw. It was a match widely recognised as the highlight of the night's in-ring action, with the sometimes divisive Punk coming out on top. The Undertaker appeared on his motorbike in support of Rhea Ripley Netflix agreed to pay more than $5bn (£4bn) for rights to show Raw and other WWE programming, including archive content. Viewers outside the US will be able to watch all weekly shows such as SmackDown, NXT and live events on the service. The company said that would include pay-per-view specials including WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Royal Rumble. It said the deal would affect fans in the USA, Canada, UK and Latin America first, before being expanded to other countries later. ""So many people use Netflix and they'll put it on and see WWE prominently,"" says Brandon Thurston, editor of wrestling site Wrestlenomics. ""So that [could] have a great positive effect for their business."" With streaming on the rise and television numbers shrinking, Brandon feels WWE has the opportunity to enter more households around the world and attract newer, younger audiences. ""We're going away from traditional TV [to] the most popular streaming platform. So it should increase that 18-49 audience even more."" Rapper Travis Scott popped up and surprised fans Raw had a three-hour runtime for 12 years, before cutting down to two at the end of 2024. WWE's chief content officer Paul 'Triple H' Levesque says the streaming platform gives them ""flexibility"" when it comes to timings. And Brandon feels it can have an impact on the style of content too, being able to have more or less from week to week. ""They have the freedom to not be bound to a time slot"", unlike normal TV timings, he says. While Brandon thinks there are overwhelming positives to the deal, he notes the reliance on the streamer could potentially be a negative. ""That's definitely a possibility that Netflix could start to lose subscribers for one reason or another.

BBC,0.1139852273145831,Sega considering Netflix-like game subscription service,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgnj7e8028o,,"Sonic x Shadow Generations sold more than 1 million copies in a single day when it launched in October Sega is considering launching its own Netflix-like subscription service for video games, a move which would accelerate gaming's transition towards streaming. There are already a number of similar services on the market - such as Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus - which see gamers pay a monthly fee for access to a range of titles rather than owning them outright. Sega's president Shuji Utsumi told the BBC such subscription products were ""very interesting"", and his firm was ""evaluating some opportunities"". ""We're thinking something - and discussing something - we cannot disclose right now,"" he said. Some in the industry have expressed concern about the move however telling the BBC it could see gamers ""shelling out more money"" on multiple subscription services. It is not just Sony and Microsoft who offer game subscriptions - there are now countless players in the space, with rivals such as Nintendo, EA and Ubisoft all offering their own membership plans. Shuji Utsumi (right) attends the Sonic 3 movie premiere in Hollywood with Sega CEO Haruki Satomi (left) and Sonic series producer Takashi Iizuka (centre) Currently, various Sega games are available across multiple streaming services. The amount these services individually charge vary depending on the features and games made available. For example, Xbox Game Pass prices range from £6.99 to £14.99 a month, while PlayStation Plus ranges from £6.99 to £13.49 a month. So it would make financial sense for Sega for people who are playing its titles to pay it subscription fees rather its rivals. It could also be attractive for people who mostly want to play Sega games - but for everyone else it could result in higher costs. Rachel Howie streams herself playing games on Twitch, where she is known as DontRachQuit to her fans, and said she was ""excited and worried"" about another subscription service ""We have so many subscriptions already that we find it very difficult to justify signing up for a new one,"" she told the BBC. ""I think that SEGA will definitely have a core dedicated audience that will benefit from this, but will the average gamer choose this over something like Game Pass?"" And Sophie Smart, Production Director at UK developer No More Robots, agreed. ""As someone whose first console was the Sega Mega Drive, what I'd love more than anything is to see Sega thriving and this feels like a step in a modern direction,"" she said. But she wondered if Sega did create a rival subscription service if this would lead to their games being removed from other services. ""If so, it could mean that consumers are shelling out more money across owning multiple subscription services,"" she said. Shuji Utsumi spoke to the BBC ahead of the premiere of the film Sonic 3 on Saturday, after a year in which he oversaw the launch of Metaphor: ReFantazio, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, and the latest Sonic the Hedgehog game. Our conversation started in an unexpected way. The very first thing Mr Utsumi said to me seemed to suggest that the firm, which dominated gaming in the 1990s with a rivalry between Sonic the Hedgehog and Nintendo's Super Mario, may have lost its way. ""I want to make Sega really shiny again,"" he said. He said Sega had been putting too much focus on domestic success in Japan, and needed to re-establish itself on a global stage, which would mean expanding past its base. ""Sega has been somehow losing confidence,"" he said. ""But why? Sega has a great RPG group, Sega has amazing IPs, Sega is a really well-known brand. ""So I was like, hey, now is not the time to be defensive - but more offensive."" He said the company was too concerned about controlling costs when he took over, and he wants to ""bring a rock and roll mentality"" to gaming. When I told him that sounded familiar - Sega's marketing in the 90s often tried to position Sonic the Hedgehog as the cool alternative to Mario - he agreed. Sonic and Mario had a storied rivalry in the 1990s, which significantly boosted sales of Sega's Mega Drive and Nintendo's SNES He said the firm now simply must ""make a great game"" in the series. ""The next one is going to be a quite challenging, quite exciting game that we are working on,"" he said. But he would not divulge whether Sega was considering a follow up to the much-loved Sonic Adventure series. ""Sonic Adventure was kind of a game-changer for Sonic,"" he said. ""When we release it, it should be good, it should be impressive - we need to meet or even exceed people's expectations, so it takes some time."" Part of the series which fans have been clamouring to see return is the Chao Garden - a much-loved virtual pet synonymous with Sonic Adventure. Mr Utsumi said ""we've been talking about it"" - but would not go into further detail, only that he could not ""say too much about it"". Mr Utsumi unsurprisingly talked up the firm's successes this year, which have included winning multiple gaming awards with new IP Metaphor: ReFantazio, made by the team behind the Persona series. But it hasn't all been positive for the firm, with job cuts in March, and Football Manager 2025 being delayed to next year. ""It was a hard decision,"" he said of the cutswhich saw 240 people lose their jobs,external. ""But when you reset the initiative, you have to make that hard decision."" And he said Football Manager had been delayed over ""a quality issue"". ""I mean, financially, maybe providing the game at an early stage can be the better choice. ""But we decided to keep having the quality level - to keep that discipline."" And he also spoke of how Sega's year has gone outside of gaming, with several film and television adaptations being capped off with the third Sonic the Hedgehog movie releasing on Saturday. ""I just saw the movie - it's so much fun. It'd be nice if that kind of excitement goes on.""

If you have ever wondered about a Hollywood star's guide to the perfect Welsh Christmas, look no further. Taron Egerton, 35, is best known for playing Elton John in the biopic Rocketman and his major role in Kingsman spy films, and he is in the new Netflix action thriller Carry-On. But before finding stardom he grew up on Anglesey and then moved to Aberystwyth in Ceredigion when he was 12. His ideal Christmas includes drinks at 10am, Welsh singing and cranberry sauce... with mayonnaise. Yes, mayonnaise. Taron Egerton stars in Christmas action Netflix film Rocketman star credits Wales for love of singing Is there a Welsh Christmas? However, his festive fun does not include the tradition of theMari Lwyd,external. Meaning ""grey mare"", it is a figure of a horse carried from door to door by wassailing groups - who go from home to home singing Christmas carols - during the festive season in south Wales. He seemed unaware of the tradition as he held up a horse skull figure and told  Netflix during a promotional interview for Carry-On: ""I would advise the next time you do a segment on Wales, don't do research from the occult."" But while his Christmas may be Mari Lwyd-less, he said the period would not be complete without singing. And drinks too, which are poured at 10am on Christmas Day for the Egerton family. ""We really like to fuel those family arguments as much as we can before they happen,"" he said. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

The actor wrote in a post on Instagram that as he was returning home after starring in West End musical Hairspray on 4 September, he was sprayed with an incapacitating liquid, thrown to the ground and kicked by officers who had mistaken him for a suspect. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it had advised one officer ""they were under criminal investigation"", as well as also being investigated for potential gross misconduct.

""In a flash, I was face-down on the pavement with multiple officers holding me down, forcing my head into the ground,"" he said. ""I couldn't see anything, but I could hear my mum nearby, screaming and crying, begging them to let me go. ""That feeling of helplessness will never leave me.

The streaming service wanted a red plaque with a quote from the show erected in The Vennel Steps, where its lead characters have a key scene. It had applied to City of Edinburgh Council, for planning permission as the sign would be secured to the wall of a listed building, built in 1910. A heritage watchdog condemned the proposal as a ""simple exercise in product marketing"" and the council has nowrefused permission,externalon heritage grounds. The sign was proposed for the bottom of the steps, opposite the 16th Century Flodden Wall - which once marked the perimeter of Edinburgh. David Givan, City of Edinburgh Council’s chief planning officer said the application received 38 objections. “The proposal fails to have special regard to the desirability of preserving the character of the building and would adversely impact on its special architectural and historic interest,"" he said. “The proposal represents an inappropriate and low quality addition to the listed building, failing to meet the statutory requirement of retaining its character. It would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area.” The series follows the lives of Emma and Dexter, played by Ambika Mod and Leo Woodall The quote on the proposed sign reads: ""It's one of the great cosmic mysteries. How someone can go from being a total stranger to the most important person in your life."" Last month Tery Levinthal, the director of the Cockburn Association, spoke out against the proposal. He said: ""If every production or every connection with a novel or film or TV series did the same, one wouldn't be able to see parts of the city due to the proliferation of plaques."" One Day, based on the book by David Nicholls, follows the lives of Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew on St Swinthin's Day - 15 July - every year. They meet at their Edinburgh University graduation ball in 1988 and have a failed one-night stand. The series explores the couple's relationship as they grow up, move apart and together, and experience joy and heartbreak.

BBC,0.1139852273145831,The Sidemen: We've hit YouTube limit so are moving to Netflix,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2nr2g44veo,,"The Sidemen have been among Britain's most popular YouTubers for the past decade The Sidemen are used to making content for YouTube, but say they've now ""hit the limit"" on what they can achieve on the video sharing platform so are moving ""to something even bigger"". The British YouTube superstars have announced that the second season of their reality show, Inside, will debut on Netflix next year. The streaming giant will also make a US version. The Sidemen - the seven-strong group that includes content creator, rapper and boxer KSI - have more than 146 million YouTube subscribers between them. Vik Barn - aka Vikkstar123 - told the BBC the move was ""ambitious"" but it was ""exciting to conquer a new challenge"". He said: ""Netflix is the gold standard and part of us working with them is to say that over the past decade we've managed to go from filming content in our bedrooms to working with the biggest streaming platform in the world."" The first season of Inside was available on YouTube The Sidemen started creating YouTube content in the early 2010s. They started by playing and reacting to video games, but in the past decade the group of friends have branched out to comedy sketches, travel challenges, podcasts and a dating show. They now employ a production team of more than 100 people who help create the videos and generate ideas, Vik said. One idea that has ""massively taken off"" is Inside, which launched in June on YouTube and racked up 14 millions of views for its opening episode. The contest's first season saw 10 influencers locked in a house for a week as they battled for a prize with up to £1m. Its success caught the attention of Netflix bosses, who have now commissioned a second UK season and a US version of the show. Both will be on Netflix instead of YouTube. ""YouTube opened so many doors for us so we can't diminish its power and it's still unrivalled in some ways,"" Vik explained. ""But working with Netflix is a cool opportunity for us to reach a new audience. ""We're at a ceiling with YouTube - we bring in 20 million UK viewers each month and now we're thinking about how to connect with different people."" Aside from Vik and KSI, the other Sidemen are Miniminter, Zerkaa, TBJZL, Behzinga and W2S. Vik said the group, who are aged between 27 and 32, had some reservations about bringing their work to a new platform because ""we've never done it before and we're all very particular about the way we work"". ""We also move at a really fast pace - sometimes we shoot on Wednesday and by Sunday we will have uploaded a two-hour video. So we wanted to make sure Netflix were happy with the fast turnarounds and us being very dynamic."" But the seven members vote on everything and were unanimous in the decision to move their reality show to Netflix, he said. The group will serve as executive producers and have ""full control to make the new season bigger and better than the last"". They aren't the only online stars to take their own big-money game show to a conventional streaming platform instead of putting it on YouTube. MrBeast, the world's most popular YouTuber, will launch Beast Games on Amazon Prime Video on 19 December, although that showhas been at the centre of controversy. The Sidemen have just sold out a charity football match at Wembley Stadium As one of the UK's biggest YouTube content creators, 29-year-old Vik is very aware of how many young men look up to him. But he said it's not his job to be a role model. ""In our videos we're just ourselves, we're not aiming to be certain characters, and first and foremost we're content creators who make fun videos."" He added that the Sidemen had a ""unified stance on not speaking about political and social issues"". ""Sometimes we feel pressure to, but we would rather leave this to the experts."" Part of the reason for this decision is the intense media scrutiny they face. KSI recently faced backlash after he shared a video of Donald Trump drinking a bottle of Prime, an energy drink he co-founded. Some saw that as promoting and supporting Trump ahead of the US election. However, Vik responded by saying the group ""try not to over analyse things"". ""Everything we do will always upset a small group of people but you just have to move forward,"" he said. Vik says it's exciting to see Netflix move into live entertainment after the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson boxing event The Sheffield-based creator also said the group had got better at ""ignoring the trolling and hate"". ""The internet has become a very turbulent place recently and occasionally things do get to us. ""We try and just think about how proud we are of everything we've built and that helps us cancel out the negativity."" Vik said ""people thought I was weird"" when he first started making content a decade ago. ""At school people would think I was strange for videoing myself playing games and that there was something wrong with me when I was recording myself on my phone in public. ""And my parents were not happy at all with how much time I was spending on YouTube, but they said as long as I got good grades at school then I could carry on."" The Sidemen have been working together for more than a decade, and in recent months there have been rumours that the group may disband soon. However, Vik quashed those rumours, saying: ""Right now everything is fantastic. ""We never really know where we're going in the future but there is absolutely no end in sight right now.""

Egerton grew up on Anglesey before moving to Aberystwyth when he was 12 years old. “I didn’t want to do something that felt like an archetypal action hero,” said Egerton. ""What we kept our eyes on was making sure that we made him feel as relatable and as normal as possible... whatever normal is in the extraordinary situation he’s in.” Carry-On's director says the film takes inspiration from Die Hard The film's villain, played by Jason Bateman, is known only as The Traveller and is often heard via an earpiece worn by Egerton's character Kopek. “There were times when I was lucky enough to have Jason Bateman come in and perform with me from another room and it was an incredible luxury,"" said Egerton. “But those early scenes in the movie where I didn’t really have anything or anyone to interact with except for a voice in my ear were a new kind of challenge!

Egerton is best known for his roles as Eggsy in Kingsman: The Secret Service, and as Elton John in the critically acclaimed biopic, Rocketman. Director Jaume Collet-Serra said the film drew inspiration from the '80s classic Die Hard itself. “Everyone wants to make the next Die Hard and the reality is that no one ever will — it’s a perfect movie that can’t be replicated, and also a very specific product of its time,” said Collet-Serra. “But when I read the script for Carry-On, I felt like I had found a more grounded version of Die Hard — which was our North Star for the entire process — for a new generation.” Carry-On heads to Netflix on 13 December 2024.

The event, which was free for subscribers, is being hailed by the tech giant as a ""record breaking night"". However, fans hoping to watch have expressed their anger and disappointment after some reported Netflix crashed repeatedly throughout the fight. But there was also criticism from those who were able to tune in, with many saying theyfound the boxing match lacklustre. In the bout, which took place at the AT&T Stadium in Texas, former world heavyweight champion Tyson, 58,was beaten by YouTuber-turned-fighter Paul, 27. The fight attracted a huge amount of media coverage. Tyson is one of the most famous boxers on the planet, while Paul drew in a younger audience. There was a star-studded ringside audience including Charlize Theron, Ralph Macchio, Joe Jonas and Hasan Minhaj. Paul says 120 million viewers watched it live globally on Netflix, while the tech firm later stated ""60 million households"" around the world tuned in. It said it will reveal further viewing figures early next week. But some viewers reported experiencing buffering issues on the site, and some said they simply couldn't get onto it.

Netflix declined to comment on the technical glitches. Fans were left frustrated after buffering issues on Netflix prevented them watching the fight Brendan Ashford, who lives in Devon, told BBC News he stayed up late to watch the fight, which took place in the early hours of Saturday morning UK time. ""I was interested to see how Mike Tyson, at 58, would perform against a much younger guy,"" he said. ""I'm not in the habit of staying up late, but I thought it was worth it."" He tried signing in on Netflix at around 04:00 GMT, and says initially it loaded 25%, and then it got to 75%, but after that it got stuck. ""I knew I had a good connection, so then I looked on social media and saw others were also experiencing issues,"" he said. ""It was really disappointing. I kept trying for a good hour before I gave up."" Mr Ashford said it made him wonder how Netflix would fare with future live sports events, given the problems people encountered this time. ""It can't be good for their reputation,"" he said.

The technical reason for the delay was unclear but the streaming giant said it was ""incredibly sorry"". No reason has been given for these latest issues, but Chris Stokel-Walker, a tech reporter, said that the huge demand to watch the fight was ""Netflix's undoing"". ""Netflix has done live broadcasting before,"" he said. ""What's different, was that this fight was so hyped. ""There were so many viewers that were wanting to watch this, given the personalities involved - Jake Paul with his huge following, Mike Tyson returning to the ring for the first time in decades. ""Even people who aren't major boxing fans wanted to tune in because of all the coverage. ""As a result, there was additional demand well above and beyond your average live event, like a comedy special, or the live golf tournament they previously broadcast."" Mr Stokel-Walker said that with Netflix intending to move towards more live sports in future, including a new deal with WWE from next year, it ""needs to get this fixed"". ""They have to expect that if they're going to get into this world, they're going to have to get used to this volume of people coming,"" he said. ""The Tyson vs Paul fight was one of the most high profile examples of an event they’ve done live, so it's really not ideal. ""People will be watching this and wondering can they cope.""

BBC,0.1139852273145831,Netflix Netherlands and France offices raided in tax fraud probe,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy1vze09wwo,,"French investigators raided Netflix's Paris offices on Tuesday morning Offices of streaming giant Netflix in Paris and Amsterdam have been raided by the French and Dutch authorities as part of an investigation into tax fraud, French judicial sources say. Officials from the two countries have been co-operating on the case since the investigation was opened in November 2022. Netflix has not as yet made any specific comment on the raids, but insists it complies with tax laws wherever it operates. The Amsterdam office is the headquarters of the company's operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The French investigation is being carried out by the National Financial Prosecutor's office (PNF), a special unit used for investigations into high-profile white-collar crime. It relates to suspicions of ""covering up serious tax fraud and off-the-books work"", according to the PNF. The company is also under investigation for tax filings for 2019, 2020 and 2021. The French sources said authorities in the Netherlands were conducting simultaneous searches, and that co-operation between the two countries had been going on for ""many months"". Last year, French media outlet La Lettre reported that until 2021, Netflix in France minimised its tax payments by declaring its turnover generated in France to the Netherlands. After it abandoned this arrangement, La Lettre said, its annual declared turnover in France  jumped from €47.1m ($51.3m; £39.6m) in 2020 to €1.2bn in 2021. However, the outlet says investigators are trying to determine whether Netflix continued to attempt to minimise its profits after 2021. Netflix arrived in France more than 10 years ago, opening its Paris office in 2020. It has some 10 million subscribers in the country, according to AFP news agency.

""Everything about the Welsh culture from the eisteddfod, everything is surrounded by poetry and dance and art in general,"" she said.

BBC,0.1139852273145831,"STAGE, Agrostar, DeHaat: India’s start-ups look to villages to drive next leg of growth",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62gpp3dn15o,,"A bulk of India’s 1.4 billion people live in villages The tiny villages of Haryana state in India’s rural north-west find themselves in an unlikely spotlight these days. Farmers' homes in hamlets around the industrial town of Rohtak are suddenly in demand, doubling up as movie sets. Alongside the mooing of cows, it isn’t unusual to hear a director shouting ""lights, camera, action"" here. A new start-up, called STAGE, has spawned a nascent film industry in this hinterland. ""Batta"", a high-octane drama about power and injustice, is just the latest in half-a-dozen movies under production in the area, Vinay Singhal, founder of STAGE, told the BBC on the film’s sets. “There were just a dozen odd Haryanvi films made in India's history before we came in. Since 2019, we’ve made more than 200,” says Mr Singhal. STAGE makes content for largely under-served provincial audiences, keeping hyper-local tastes, dialectical quirks and the rural cultural syntax in mind. There are 19,500 different dialects in India, and STAGE has identified 18 that are spoken by a large enough population to merit their own film industry. The app currently offers content in two languages - Rajasthani and Haryanvi. It has three million paying subscribers and is planning to expand and include other dialects like Maithili and Konkani, which are spoken in north-east and coastal-west India, respectively. “We’re also on the verge of closing a funding round from an American venture capitalist firm to expand into these territories,” says Mr Singhal, who appeared along with his co-founders on the Indian version ofShark Tank, a business reality show, a year ago. Farmers' homes around Rohtak in Haryana state are doubling up as movie sets, thanks to start-ups STAGE is among a growing number of Indian start-ups that are betting big on the rural market opportunity as the next growth frontier. Others include players like Agrostar and DeHaat. While a bulk of India’s 1.4 billion people still live in its 650,000 villages, they’ve hardly been a market for its booming tech start-ups so far. Asia’s third-largest economy has been a hotbed for innovation, birthing several dozen unicorns - or tech companies valued at over $1bn - but they’ve all largely built for the “top 10%” of urban Indians, according to Anand Daniel, partner at Accel, which has funded some of the country’s most successful ventures, from Flipkart to Swiggy and Urban Company. While there have been notable exceptions like online marketplace Meesho, or a few farm technology players, the start-up boom has largely bypassed India’s villages. That’s now changing as more founders successfully cater to rural consumers and get funded for their ideas. “Investors don’t show you the door anymore,” says Mr Singhal. “Five years ago, I didn’t get any money at all. I had to bootstrap the company.” Accel itself is now cutting more cheques to entrepreneurs solving for the rural market, recently announcing it will invest up to $1m in rural start-ups through its pre-seed accelerator programme. Unicorn India Ventures, another local VC fund, says 50% of their investments are now in start-ups based in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. And in July this year, the Japanese auto giant Suzuki announced a $40m India fund to invest in start-ups building for rural markets. The use of smartphones is growing among middle-income rural families So what’s driving this shift? The untapped market opportunity is large, says Mr Daniel, and there’s a growing realisation among investors and founders that rural doesn’t necessarily mean poor. Two-thirds of India’s population live in the hinterland and spend about $500bn annually. In fact, the top 20% of this demographic spends more money than half of those that live in the cities, according to Accel’s own estimates. “As India adds $4tn to GDP over the next decade, at least 5% of that will be digitally influenced, and coming from ‘Bharat' or rural India,” says Mr Daniel. That’s a $200bn incremental opportunity. Giving tailwind to this is the growing penetration of smartphones among middle-income rural families. Some 450 million Indians now use one outside its cities - which is more than the entire US population. And click-of-a-button digital payments through the much-touted UPI interface has been a game-changer for companies looking beyond the metros to expand their offering. “Five or seven years ago, the ability to reach this target group - be it digitally, logistically or in terms of getting payments - wasn’t easy. But the timing right now is much better for this generation of start-ups trying to address this market,” says Mr Daniel. Also, while most innovation was happening in cities like Mumbai and Bengaluru a decade ago, a growing number of entrepreneurs are now emerging from smaller towns, driven by factors such as lower operating costs, availability of local talent, and government initiatives aimed at promoting entrepreneurship in non-metro areas, according to a report from Primus Ventures. Being close to the ground may have also contributed to exposing founders to the potential of the vast non-metro market. But there are challenges - small-town consumers are price-conscious and geographically dispersed But cracking rural India is easier said than done. The small town consumer is price-conscious and geographically dispersed. The  number of addressable consumers in any given postcode is far smaller than the cities. Infrastructure also continues to lag, so “distribution isn’t easy, and operating costs are high”, says Gautam Malik, chief revenue officer at Frontier Markets, a rural e-commerce start-up that does last-mile deliveries to villages with populations below 5,000. Besides, those using urban templates and force-fitting them to the village context will fail, says Mr Malik. His company quickly realised why traditional e-commerce wasn’t able to penetrate the very last mile. The village customer simply didn’t trust her money with a third party that didn’t have local presence. To build that trust factor, Mr Malik and his team had to tie up with village-level women entrepreneurs to act as their sales and delivery agents. Such differentiation and a commitment for the long haul will be critical, he says, to winning rural India and cracking that incremental $200bn market opportunity.

BBC,0.1139852273145831,Heartstopper: 'How Netflix show's eating disorder story helps me',https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdrj7v5z725o,,"Kit Connor and Joe Locke, who play Nick and Charlie in the Netflix show The latest series of popular LGBT teen drama Heartstopper is all aboutNick and Charlie’s relationship. But this series also brings Charlie’s eating disorder to the fore, a topic that is rarely talked about in the LGBT community despite studies showing it's a common experience. In real life, there is one school day in Year 9 that Heartstopper fan Sharan, who uses the pronoun they, will never forget. After years of bullying, they were outed by a classmate as pansexual - and instantly became a target. Sharan started to avoid the school canteen as a result and would spend lunch money on trinkets and hobbies, rather than food. It was a pattern of behaviour that went undetected for months, until a teacher asked whether they hadanxieties around eating. “The teacher asked me directly after they caught me skipping lunch,” Sharan says. “It always lived in the back of my mind [that I might have an eating disorder], but I never really saw it as a problem because no-one else knew about it and I could hide it.” If you've been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support can be found onBBC Action Line Sharan says Heartstopper has become a big topic of conversation among friends Sharan, who is now 18, is not alone in their experience as a young LGBT woman. In 2021,Just like Us found,externalthat lesbian and bisexual teens were more than twice as likely to have had an eating disorder compared to straight girls, from a survey of nearly 3,000 teens across 375 UK schools. The charity’s then-chief executive Dominic Arnall said homophobia was the main reason driving poor mental health and self-harming behaviours in the community. The eating disorder charity Beat suggests that people can perceive eating orders as only affecting young middle class heterosexual white girls which can make some people with eating disorders feel invisible, like Sharan, who is of Asian heritage. But it’s not just stereotyping that can make LGBT teens with eating disorders feel excluded. Matthew Todd, the former editor of gay magazine Attitude, points to a lack of support in schools, where coming out can still be very difficult and come with “bullying, feeling isolated, feeling you can’t tell people”. “When you have been told not to like yourself, you see yourself as your physical appearance, so we turn those things on ourselves,"" he says. Matthew says the rise of social media and “visual culture, [where] you cannot get away from images of bodies” may also help explain the higher rates of eating disorders within the LGBT community. Social media wasn’t around 20 years ago when James, who is gay, first developed anorexia aged 14. James was just 14 when he realised he had an eating disorder He says growing up in Wales in the 1990s meant there were few clinics that even treated disorders – and he says some therapists advised him that accepting he was gay could help overcome his eating disorder. His gender also complicated things as “the specialists were quite confused about me being male,” he says. “I was treated as a bit of a rare specimen.” It took eight years for him to recover from anorexia, but soon afterwards he developed bulimia. Now aged 35, he has learned to manage the condition. James says gay men of all ages still feel pressure to have muscular bodies because they are still traumatised from being bullied at a young age, but getting into yoga and “practicing self-compassion"" has helped him recover. According to the Priory, which treats people with mental health problems, more than one million people in the UK live with an eating disorder - and about a quarter of those are men. Behind the scenes of Heartstopper series three Heartstopper director wishes show existed when he grew up How Heartstopper helped older fan open up on sexuality Just Like Us found in its survey that gay male youths were six times more likely to have an eating disorder compared to heterosexual boys. James believes theHeartstopper storyline might encourage those who are strugglingin the community to reach out for help. In the latest season, Charlie spends time at a residential clinic and finds a pathway towards recovery. Heartstopper’s author, Alice Oseman, was heavily involved with the Netflix show and was keen to illustrate that the route to getting better isn’t always clear - but is possible with the right support. Sharan was able to find the support they needed through the youth group Mosaic LGBT+, able to talk openly and “the mentors showed real care”. Sharan says Heartstopper has become a real talking point among friends. “Charlie faces the same struggles as I did,” they say. “It’s nice to see a positive storyline of someone who does succeed in getting help and getting better, it makes me feel hopeful.” You can listen to Access All's Heartstopper podcast onBBC Sounds.

BBC,0.1139852273145831,Netflix raises prices as password boost fades,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq5exj06vg6o,,"Netflix is starting to raise prices in some countries as growth spurred by its crackdown on password sharing starts to fade. The film and TV streaming giant said it had already lifted subscription fees in Japan and parts of Europe as well as the Middle East and Africa over the last month. Changes in Italy and Spain are now being rolled-out. In its latest results, Netflix announced that it had added 5.1 million subscribers between July and September - ahead of forecasts but the smallest gain in more than a year. The company is under pressure to show investors what will power growth in the years ahead, as its already massive reach makes finding new subscribers more difficult. The last time Netflix saw signs of slowdown, in 2022, it launched measures to stop password sharing and said it would offer a new streaming option with advertisements. The crackdown unleashed a new wave of growth. The firm has added more than 45 million new members since last year and has 282 million subscribers globally. Analysts also expect advertisements to eventually become big business for Netflix. For now, however, Netflix has said it remains ""early days"" and warned it did not expect it to start driving growth until next year, despite many subscribers opting for the ad-supported plan. The plan, which is the company's least expensive option, accounted for 50% of new sign-ups in the places where it is offered in the most recent quarter, Netflix said. Baby Reindeer, created by and starring Richard Gadd, has been a big hit for Netflix Even without a boost from advertising, Netflix said revenue in the July-September period was up 15% compared with the same period last year, to more than $9.8bn (£7.5bn). Profit also rose from $1.6bn in the same period last year to $2.3bn. Netflix last raised prices in the UK and US in 2023 but that only affected certain plans. It has left the price of its popular ""standard plan"" without adverts untouched since 2022. In the past, the company has sometimes experimented with pricing in smaller countries before making changes in major markets, such as the US and UK. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Netflix's strong financial positionput the firm in a position to keepspending money to make new hits - the key if it hopes to raise prices without backlash. ""This is inherently a fickle market, with consumers happy to swap streamer if they don’t think they’re getting value,"" he said. ""The addition of fresh content is key to that, especially in areas like sporting events, and could give Netflix the edge it needs to push prices higher and keep customers coming back for more.” One of Netflix's biggest successes has been Baby Reindeer, a drama created by and starring Scottish comedian Richard Gadd.

Growing up, it was not just her voice, but people who looked like her that she believed did not belong on television, in films and in books, because they ""didn't matter"". Now she is starring as the Queen of the Underworld alongside Goldblum's Zeus in Netflix's darkly comedic re-imagining of Greek mythology. It is the first time, after a career that has included roles in Black Mirror, Holby City and Silent Witness, where she has not been told to ditch her native accent. Is commuting changing Welsh accents? Black Mirror actress receives Bafta Cymru award When she first started her career, she said this would not have been allowed, adding: ""It's testimony to what's going on TV and film-wise in Wales, right? ""That I'm allowed to do that, because for decades before they'd have me do any accent except a Cardiff accent, because nobody knows what it is. ""What is it? Where is it? What does it mean? It says a lot that people from all over the world suddenly know where that fits."" But it was not just her voice she did not think fitted - it was people like her, whether it was on television, in films, or in the books she read. She is one of Wales' most successful actresses, having starred in dramas such as The Pact, and last year was given the prestigious Sian Phillips Award by Bafta Cymru, for her significant contribution to film and television. But growing up, she rarely saw girls who looked like her on the screen, which affected how she felt about herself. ""So far as I knew, hair was meant to grow down,"" she toldBBC Radio Wales' Books That Made Me. ""It was not meant to grow up and out like mine did. What kind of hair did that?"" It was the same with the books she read. Rakie Ayola was confused why nobody had hair like hers on television when she was a child Ayola, now 56, added: ""I didn't spend my time thinking 'why does no-one look like me?', I just thought no-one that looks like me would ever be in a book. ""People in books, they looked like my friends from school. They were blonde, blue-eyed. They had ponytails... and it never occurred to me that someone at the centre of a story could look like me. ""Was it the books I was reading that were making me feel bad about myself? I just felt like, people that matter look like this. They have hair like that. They talk like this, they dress like that, they live like this. ""People that don't matter, just aren't in books."" Ayola said there were more books with black children represented when she had her daughters - her eldest is now 27 - but she still had to search them out. Despite this, she could still relate to the white heroines in books she read. ""I could identify with Anne of Green Gables... I recognised that Anne also felt 'where am I meant to be?'. ""So it was a massive connection. It is easier, if you've seen yourself... but I wouldn't want people to go to the other extreme and think that if you don't physically look the same, you have nothing in common with them, because that's dangerous too."" Jeff Goldblum has been in Hollywood blockbusters including Jurassic Park and Independence Day She has felt at home filming Kaos, partly because she was obsessed with the stories of Greek mythology growing up, and even went through a phase of worshipping Greek gods. ""When I was 16, having gone to my local church for the six, seven years before, I overnight fell out of love with religion as I understood it, and decided that I would worship the Greek gods,"" she said. ""I just remember saying, I need to worship someone, I'll worship them instead and that was because I had a book about Greek mythology and I love Jason and the Argonauts. ""And for about a year I would say 'I worship the Greek gods, that's my religion'. So bonkers."" Despite spending four weeks in Netflix's top 10 when it was released at the end of August, the streaming service has just cancelled the second series, disappointing fans of the show...."

The top-rated reply reading: ""Please, let's try with a different streaming service or network."" Covell previously wrote The End of the F***ing World in collaboration with Channel 4 and Netflix, which reached a natural conclusion after two seasons. Covell's statement followsan emotional post,externalfrom actress Aurora Perrineau, who portrays Eurydice on the show. Also writing on Instagram, she said ""this one hurts"" but thanked her fellow cast members, who included Janet McTeer, Billie Piper, Leila Farzad and Stephen Dillane. “Everyone was brilliant and uniquely themselves. Every performance surprised and excited me,” she wrote. “I can’t believe I got to do this with all of you. We made something weird, dark, hilarious, deranged, and absolutely tragic — something entirely human.” At-home streaming grew in popularity during Covid lockdowns Netflix's swift decision to cancel a high-profile, big-budget show like Kaos reflects a shifting strategy across the streaming sector as it evolves. Streaming service show cancellations are not uncommon and have regularly frustrated subscribers, such as Netflix ending The OA in 2019, and Shadow and Bone in 2023 - after cliffhanger season finales. They both sparked fan-led petitions for their return. This year aloneDisney+ has pulled Star Wars spin-off The Acolyte,externalafter one season, alongsideParamount Plus cancelling Halo,externalandMax pulling Tokyo Vice,external.My Lady Jane was also culled,externalby Amazon Prime. These recent examples are arguably part of an industry trend. The past decade has seen rapid growth in streaming platforms backing TV and film projects, drawing a billion subscribers to services by 2020 -growing as Covid lockdowns hit,external. This ""tech-industry playbook"" delivered big programme budgets but less investment in ""the basics of programme making,""wrote Stephen Armstrong in The Financial Times last year,external. When subscriber numbers temporarily stalled in 2022, streaming giants switched from chasing sign-ups to pursuing profitability. ""Streamers are far more selective with what they commission than where they were five years ago,"" TV critic Scott Bryan told the BBC. ""That means those that are really do have to work, and they have to deliver strongly"". He said that whilst Kaos started strongly,topping UK charts,externaland peaking at number three for English-language shows, the publicly available viewing data suggests interest tapered off. The Hollywood Reporter,externaldescribed the show's initial 14.9m views over its first four weeks as ""a middling number by the streamer’s standards."" Streaming services like Netflix remain private about the specifics of their financial and programming decisions. However,Wired previously reported,externala ""viewership-versus-cost-of-renewal review process"" in deciding recommissions.Forbes has similarly cited,externaloverall series engagement as a key internal metric. Bryan said the shows that Netflix have recently recommissioned, such as Supercell, Bridgerton and The Gentlemen, point to a focus on ""series that can spawn franchises and multiple seasons,"" mirroring the shifting industry focus. ""Kaos is a very good show, but it's also a very expensive show given the cast attached and the special effects - it's clear it just didn't match internal expectations for there to be a second season"", says Bryan. Looking ahead, he feels there is potential reputational danger for individual streamers if popular, word-of-mouth shows keep getting cancelled, potentially making subscribers wary - and weary - of committing to a series only for it to be cancelled. Analysis from the Wall Street Journal,externalsuggests customers already have little brand loyalty, regularly cancelling and renewing different subscriptions. But for now Netflix's bottom line, its subscriber base, remains strong, buoyed by international hits including Baby Reindeer and a new ad-supported subscription tier. The streamer added 8m subscribers in the latest quarter, taking its total subscriber count to over 270m worldwide. The BBC has contacted Netflix for comment...."

The streaming service wants a red plaque with a quote from the show erected in The Vennel, where its lead characters have a key scene. It hasapplied to City of Edinburgh Council,externalfor planning permission as the sign would be secured to the wall of a listed building, built in 1910. But Cockburn Association director Terry Levinthal called for planners to refuse permission, arguing it was a ""simple exercise in product marketing"". I rarely saw people like me in lead roles, says One Day star One Day, based on the book by David Nicholls, follows the lives of Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew on St Swinthin's Day - 15 July - every year. They meet at their Edinburgh University graduation ball in 1988 and have a failed one-night stand. The series explores the couple's relationship as they grow up, move apart and together, and experience joy and heartbreak. One memorable scene in Edinburgh was filmed in The Vennel, a historic staircase that runs from The Grassmarket along the boundary of George Heriot's School. At the top of the steps is a famous view of Edinburgh Castle. The plaque was temporarily fitted to the wall on St Swithin's Day (July 15) this year. The sign commemorating One Day is proposed for the bottom of the stairs and on the opposite side to the 16th Century Flodden Wall - which once marked the perimeter of Edinburgh. The quote on the sign reads: ""It's one of the great cosmic mysteries. How someone can go from being a total stranger to the most important person in your life.""

""Is this a simple exercise in product marketing? Yes."" He said the Netflix production ""really had nothing to do with Edinburgh"" and most existing plaques in the city either related to key historic figures who had an important impact or role to play in the city, or to particular events or places. He said it opened up the wider discussion about film tourism in the city. The sign was attached to the proposed wall in The Vennel in Edinburgh on 15 July - it has now been removed ""People will travel long distances to stand in the spot of their favourite film characters and the causation impacts of that can be considerable,""  Mr Levinthal said. He pointed to the impact of tourism on the town ofFujikawaguchiko, Japan, where a 2.5m (8ft) black mesh net was installed to block the view of Mount Fuji. The screen was intended to deter tourists who were littering, parking poorly, and behaving antisocially to take photos for social media. The screen was effective in reducing congestion in the area. However, tourists quickly found ways to get around the barrier by poking small holes in the screen that were the right size for a camera lens. The barrier was eventually taken down after successfully deterring tourists. ""So little insignificant things all totalled up together can actually have major impacts,"" Mr  Levinthal said. Netflix said it wished to make no comment...."
BBC,0.1139852273145831,Netflix fails to get Baby Reindeer lawsuit dropped,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj31lpvnzl3o,,"Jessica Gunning played Martha in Baby Reindeer Netflix has failed in its attempt to persuade a judge to throw out a defamation lawsuit brought by the woman who inspired the stalker character in hit series Baby Reindeer. Fiona Harvey claims the streaming giant told ""brutal lies"" about her to more than 50 million viewers around the world. The show, created by Richard Gadd, is billed as ""a true story"", but certain key events, like the conviction for stalking, did not happen in real life, the judge concluded. Netflix said: ""We intend to defend this matter vigorously and to stand by Richard Gadd's right to tell his story."" In his ruling, Judge Gary Klausner wrote: ""There is a major difference between stalking and being convicted of stalking in a court of law."" There were other substantial disparities between what really happened and what was shown on screen, he noted. Ms Harvey says also she did not stalk a police officer, sexually assault Gadd, violently attack him in a pub by smashing a bottle over his head and gouging his eyes, or wait outside his home for up to 16 hours a day. Netflix argued those things should be viewed as ""substantially true"" because she did arguably similar things in real life. However, the judge wrote: ""There are major differences between inappropriate touching and sexual assault, as well as between shoving and gouging another's eyes."" Gunning recently won an Emmy for acting, while Gadd won three, for acting, writing and producing Gadd's original stage play was billed slightly differently - as being ""based on a true story"" - which suggests ""certain details were likely false"", the judge wrote. A Sunday Times article from June quoted TV industry sources as saying Gadd ""expressed concerns"" with Netflix about presenting it as simply ""a true story"". The fact the company went ahead ""suggests a reckless disregard of whether statements in the series were false"", Judge Klausner wrote. Netflix argued that most viewers would understand the claims made in the show to be ""not factual"" because it was shot in the style of a drama. However, the judge disagreed, writing: ""While the statements were made in a series that largely has the trappings of a black comedy-drama, the very first episode states unequivocally that 'this is a true story', thereby inviting the audience to accept the statements as fact."" Netflix also said the similarities between the real and fictionalised people were so broad that average viewers would not have been able to identify Ms Harvey as Martha. ""The court disagrees,"" the judge wrote. ""This is not the typical case where a plaintiff happens to be one of hundreds of people that match a fictional character’s broad characteristics. ""Rather, Martha and Plaintiff [Ms Harvey] have specific similarities that few others could claim to share."" However, the judge did side with Netflix in some parts of Ms Harvey's case, dismissing her negligence and gross negligence claims, and her request for punitive damages. Baby Reindeer has been one of the biggest TV hits of the past year, and recently won six Emmy Awards in the US.

BBC,0.1139852273145831,Monsters - The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story: Netflix show sparks controversy,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20mzd788n3o,,"Cooper Koch (left) and Nicholas Chavez play Erik and Lyle Menendez respectively A new Netflix drama about two brothers who killed their parents has been criticised by one of the real-life men it is based on. Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story was released last week and shot to the top of Netflix's streaming chart. The show stars Cooper Koch and Nicholas Alexander Chavez as the two brothers, and Javier Bardem and Chloe Sevigny as their parents. The series is a follow-up to the controversial first Monsters series about US serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer,which was criticised in some quarters for being insensitive. The show was created by Ryan Murphy, the director, writer and producer behind series including Glee, Pose, The Watcher, Feud, American Horror Story, Hollywood and Ratched, and Ian Brennan, who co-created Glee. In its first weekend of release,the series is reported to have had 12.3 million views,external, although we don't know how many individual viewers or households that amounts to as it will be split across the nine episodes. Erik (left) and Lyle Menendez, pictured during their trial in Los Angeles in March 1994 Lyle and Erik Menendez are two brothers who killed their parents on 20 August 1989. Jose and Kitty Menendez were shot multiple times at close range at their mansion in Beverly Hills. The brothers, who were 21 and 18 at the time, initially told police they found their parents dead when they arrived home. The pair were eventually tried for the murders, first individually, with one jury for each brother. However, both juries were deadlocked, resulting in a mistrial, and the pair were later tried again together. The brothers claimed they committed the murders in self defence after years of alleged physical, emotional and sexual abuse. They said they feared their father would kill them after they threatened to expose him. But the prosecution argued they wanted to kill their parents in order to inherit their money. During their second, joint trial, the judge excluded evidences of abuse from their defence case. A jury found them guilty and the pair were convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in 1996. They were sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Oscar-winning actor Javier Bardem (left) plays the boys' father The Netflix drama presents the murders from different perspectives as it explores what might have led the siblings to kill their parents. It follows the events surrounding the murders, including the brothers' claims of physical, emotional and sexual abuse. But the show also makes efforts to show things from the parents' point of view, something its creators have said was based on extensive research. Monsters was released on Thursday, 19 September, and quickly climbed to the top of Netflix's streaming chart - as is often the case with shows in the hugely popular true crime genre. But the show hasn't gone down as well with critics. In a two-star review,the Guardian's Jesse Hassenger described,externalit as exhausting and repetitive"" whileIndieWire's Ben Travers said,externalit was a ""messy, salacious slog"". Variety's Aramide Tinubu added:,external""Despite the gripping subject matter and the outstanding performances, [the show] has no idea what it wants to be. Therefore, it just dissolves into a retelling of unspeakable abuses and gruesome crimes."" There was a similar sentimentfrom the Telegraph's Ed Power, who said:,external""Under the withering gaze of the Netflix algorithm, no subject is too sensitive to be off-limits or turned into eyeball fodder. ""And that, in the end, is all that Monsters adds up to. It’s a competently put-together hokum made in the worst possible taste."" Javier Bardem, Nicholas Chavez, Cooper Koch and Chloë Sevigny at the show's launch in Los Angeles last week Erik and Lyle Menendez, now aged 53 and 56 respectively, are currently in prison in San Diego, California. In a statementreleased on X by his wife,,externalErik Menendez criticised the production the day after it was released, labelling the show ""disheartening slander"". ""I believed we had moved beyond the lies and ruinous character portrayals of Lyle, creating a caricature of Lyle rooted in horrible and blatant lies rampant in the show,” he said. “I can only believe they were done so on purpose. It is with a heavy heart that I say, I believe Ryan Murphy cannot be this naive and inaccurate about the facts of our lives so as to do this without bad intent.” He continued: “It is sad for me to know that Netflix’s dishonest portrayal of the tragedies surrounding our crime have taken the painful truths several steps backward - back through time to an era when the prosecution built a narrative on a belief system that males were not sexually abused, and that males experienced rape trauma differently than women. ""Those awful lies have been disrupted and exposed by countless brave victims over the last two decades who have broken through their personal shame and bravely spoken out.” Director and writer Ryan Murphy pictured discussing the series at an event in New York earlier this month Speaking to Entertainment Tonight, Murphy said:,external""I think it’s interesting that he’s issued a statement without having seen the show. He acknowledged: ""It's really hard, if it's your life, to see your life up on screen. ""The thing I find interesting, that he doesn't mention in his quote, is that if you watch the show, I would say 60-65% of our show centre around the abuse, and what they claim happened to them. ""We do it very carefully and we give them their day in court, and they talk openly about it."" But, Murphy added, he and his team felt it was important to also show things from the parents' point of view. ""In this age where people can talk about sexual abuse, talking and writing about all points of view can be controversial,"" he said. ""There were four people involved, two people are dead, what about the parents? We had an obligation as storytellers to also try and put in their perspective based on our research, which we did."" Murphy also later responded to criticism from the brothers' family about the series,telling Variety,externaltheir comments were ""predictable at best"". Members ofthe family said,externalthe pair have been ""victimised, external by this grotesque shockadrama,” adding the show is ""riddled with mistruths"". Murphy said their response was ""interesting because I would like specifics about what they think is shocking or not shocking. It’s not like we’re making any of this stuff up. It’s all been presented before"". The family's statement also said: ""The character assassination of Erik and Lyle, who are our nephews and cousins, under the guise of a 'story telling narrative', is repulsive."" They added: ""We love them and to this very day we are close to them. We also know what went on in their home and the unimaginably turbulent lives they have endured. ""Several of us were eyewitnesses to many atrocities one should never have to bear witness to.” Menendez drama creator hits back at family criticism..."
BBC,0.1139852273145831,Vince McMahon Netflix series: What does it reveal?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crr5zvyw4z7o,,"Vince McMahon is credited for WWE's growth into a global media powerhouse A new Netflix documentary claims to ""pull back the curtain"" on former WWE boss Vince McMahon -  but does it succeed? The six-part series Mr. McMahon - named after the alter-ego character he portrayed on-screen in the mid-90s - covers his life, decades-long career and the various scandals that have followed him. It features interviews with the 79-year-old himself, as well as family members, former wrestlers and business associates. But whether it tells us anything new about the real Vince McMahon is up for debate. He pulled out of filming after a former employee accused him of sex trafficking, and  some reviewers have said theseries struggles with this missing element,external. Others said it's still a fairly""honest portrait"",externaland comprehensive,depending on how much you already know going in,external. But does it get us any closer to the truth? McMahon got his own review in early. He called the series ""misleading"" and accused its makers of taking ""the predictable path of conflating the 'Mr. McMahon' character with my true self, Vince"". The billionaire businessmanresigned from WWE's parent companyat the start of this year when ex-employee Janel Grant filed a sex trafficking lawsuit against him, He'sdenied her accusationsas ""lies"" and a ""vindictive distortion of the truth"". You won't hear much about this case in the documentary, but previous allegations are discussed. WWE's first female referee Rita Chatterton accused McMahon of rape, but in the series he insists ""that never happened"" and it was ""consensual"". He withdrew his defamation lawsuit against her and last year,reports say,,externalpaid her a multimillion-dollar settlement. He also calls the US government - who took him to court on charges of illegal steroid distribution - the ""biggest bullies"". McMahon was found not guilty in that case. Former WWE star Trish Stratus says women were considered ""eye candy"" The WWE often faced criticism in the past for its portrayal of women, especially during its so-called Attitude Era between 1997 and 2002. Matches became far less family friendly, with wrestlers frequently seen bleeding and female stars competing in ""bra and panties"" bouts which ended when an opponent's costume was torn off. Former WWE Women's Champion Trish Stratus says roles for women were ""overly sexual"" and recalls once being made to get on her knees and bark like a dog before removing her clothes. ""Women were not considered wrestlers..."" she says. ""Eye candy, that’s kind of what they were at the time,"" she says in the show. Anthony White - aka Tony Atlas - agrees with her that the segments have not aged well. ""We would have been looked upon in today’s society as some of the worst human beings walking the face of the Earth,"" he tells the documentary. ""We abused the hell out of women. They were like a toy for us."" McMahon's daughter Stephanie, who often featured in storylines written by her father - which she describes as a ""little bit weird"" - says ""it was a different time in our business”. Current chief content officer and McMahon’s son-in-law Paul ""Triple H"" Levesque questions how they ""ever [got] away with that stuff"". In the documentary McMahon says the trend was ""more or less following what was going on in the entertainment business"", and some of the highest-rated segments featured women.  As the boss, Vince McMahon admitted: ""I don’t fight fair"" Vince McMahon has gained a reputation as a ruthless operator, and the documentary does explore some of the events that helped to build this image. One is a notorious stitch-up - or ""screwjob"", in wrestling terms - involving legendary wrestler Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart. During tensions over his move to rival firm World Championship Wrestling (WCW), McMahon worked with others behind Hart's back to change the scripted outcome of a 1997 match. The Canadian ended up losing his championship title to Shawn Michaels in front of a hometown crowd in Montreal. McMahon describes a similar screwjob in 1985, involving former women's champ Wendi Richter, as ""show business... nothing personal"". ""And there is nothing I wouldn’t do for business."" In the documentary, McMahon says he wanted Bret Hart to do the “right thing” for the business. ""To this day, I don’t regret any of it."" Vince McMahon controlled WWE storylines for decades McMahon shares details of his own childhood, including how he was abused by his step-father and meeting his real dad for the first time when was 12. ""I know from a psychological standpoint if you’re abused as a kid, the tendency is for you to abuse,"" he says, before adding: ""That's just a cop-out."" His own position as a father is a theme the documentary returns to repeatedly and he reveals he was ""tough"" on his own children, Shane and Stephanie. Members of the cast also describe him as a father figure. McMahon himself says: ""I still haven’t quite figured out who I am."" Characters are the lifeblood of WWE, he tells the documentary makers - but is he playing a character himself? We never quite find out. “Sometimes the lines of reality, of fact and fiction, are very blurred in our business,"" he says. Critics say this is a helpful get-out-of-jail-free card, placing blame on alter-ego Mr McMahon - a corrupt boss who abuses his power. ""Which is the character and which is me? I guess maybe it’s a blend and I would suggest that maybe one is exaggerated a little bit,"" says McMahon. ""I’m not so sure which one."" But when asked what traits he shares with the character, he says: ""None whatsoever."" Many of those close to him also seem unsure. His son Shane says: ""Mr. McMahon is an extension of Vince McMahon, but blown out of proportion."" It's a view shared by ex-champion Stone Cold Steve Austin, who says the character is ""pretty close to Vince the man"", but ""highly exaggerated"". Others, such as Shawn Michaels, say there's not much difference between the two, and WWE executive Bruce Prichard says McMahon's in-ring diatribes were similar to the ones he'd deliver in the board room. Former superstar Hulk Hogan's opinion is much more clear-cut. ""Exactly the same person, not a far stretch,"" he says. Listen to Newsbeatliveat 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen backhere.

The change will come into force from 7 October until the show moves from the USA Network channel to Netflix in January 2025. It's not confirmed whether the length will change again once the company moves to the streaming platform. The show, a staple of the WWE’s TV schedule, has been three hours long since its thousandth episode aired in July 2012. The time has long been debated among the WWE community, with some fans liking the option of being able to see more talent, but others feeling it dragged. WWE Superstar Seth ""Freakin"" Rollins has previously said it was ""obnoxiously long"". Wrestler Uncle Howdy beating Chad Gable during Raw WWE's deal with the USA Network was reportedly meant to expire in October. Viewers in the UK will also see the shorter version when watching on TNT Sports or the WWE Network. Wrestling fan Jonathan Elgie says he's happy they've taken the decision to cut it down. ""Sometimes there is too much of a good thing,"" he tells BBC Newsbeat. ""Sometimes it feels like you're watching the product for three hours and this is coming from someone who's been a wrestling fan almost my whole life. ""It's necessary at this point to shorten it down. There's a lot of filler in there that doesn't need to be in there."" In 2015 chief content officer Paul Levesque, best known by his ring name Triple H, told the Stone Cold podcast that if ""I could change anything, I'd love it to be 2 hours"". In 2022, Seth Rollins told the SI Media With Jimmy Traina podcast that he felt a three hour show meant ""everything gets stretched out"". ""You’ve got to fill three hours of television, there’s just nothing to be done. That’s just how it is. ""So I think two hours is a beautiful number for a show. And I think it’s easier to make everything mean a little bit more."" WWE fan Jonathan Elgie at WrestleMania - WWE's headline show But Jonathan also thinks there can be a downside to less time. ""Sometimes talent won't get to showcase. ""If there's a two hour show there might be talent pulled from the show that otherwise wouldn't be able to show their skills,"" Jonathan says. It is unknown whether it will shift back to three hours on Netflix but some reports in the US suggest it will. Jonathan feels the two hours until the end of the year can act as a trial. ""To see how it works. ""Obviously they have Smackdown which is two hours. That never feels like you're watching for any longer than two hours.""

The president, Mark Shapiro, described the deal as ""transformative"" at the time it was announced. ""It marries the can’t-miss WWE product with Netflix’s extraordinary global reach."" And as Raw moves, Jonathan also wants to see a shift in the programme. ""I want to see it get edgier again. ""I want to see that darker content - the less PG stuff.

From their first performance of the comedy opera Iolanthe in 1925, to Dylan Thomas' Under Milk Wood in 2024, the group has done it all over the years. The society's head of publicity, Peter Knowles, said he was ""proud"" of their legacy, and said they were continuing to work to ensure people keep coming to see their productions. Eco-friendly theatre says it will create 100 jobs Welsh should stand up to attack on culture - Sheen Welsh National Opera faces disruption over pay ""I hope that the people who started PODS would look at the society we have today and feel proud of how we've taken their legacy forwards,"" Mr Knowles said. ""It will be interesting to see how live theatre develops over the course of time. When PODS first started, there were no big musicals, it was just light operetta, now we are competing with Netflix, Youtube, all the major streaming channels. ""People's sources of entertainment now are so vast, and live theatre has to compete with that, it’s a challenge we’re enjoying."" PODS is made up of around 80 regular performers, and has 45 junior members in its youth section. They perform four shows a year, which normally includes two plays, a musical, and a pantomime around Christmas. To celebrate the anniversary, the group are putting on a series of special centenary shows in September. Rose of Persia was one of the group's first performances in 1928 PODS have performed a wide range of shows, including Rock-A-Bye Sailor in 1987 Mr Knowles said the group was working to find new productions that will attract new audiences. ""Sometimes theatre only appeals to people of certain age groups, so for us we have to work to engage people of all age groups and groups of our local community,"" he said. ""As part of that, we have tried to keep ticket costs as low as possible, so those who can't afford to go to the larger theatre venues can afford to come here. ""We are all volunteers, and our source of income to put on these shows is our tickets, but without an audience we can't do anything, so we have worked to keep ticket prices low and discounted for groups where possible."" Lauren Jenkins, 21, has followed in the footsteps of her Mother and Grandmother in performing for PODS, and is also head of the society's youth section. ""I remember going to rehearsals with my gran when I was younger, she would make us a packed lunch, and I would sit and watch her direct, it's a memory I will treasure forever,"" she said. ""I'm not the most confident person, but I get on stage and become a completely different character each time I come out. Lauren said her mum and gran (black and white picture) inspired her to get involved Lauren said she was glad she could help inspire a new generation of young people to get involved in theatre, but admitted things had changed over recent years. ""Especially with social media now, it means we have different posts for different shows,"" she said. ""It gives us a different type of publicity to what it used to be, and you have to keep on top of things in theatre.

Andy designed the Queen Elizabeth I dress for Shakespeare In Love this year Head of Costumes at PODS Andy Bradshaw said he volunteers his own time to work on designing the productions because he loves it. ""I worked in theatre for many years and in TV production design, now I'm semi-retired it gives me the opportunity to design four completely new productions in a year, and because we have the workshops, we can do quite lavish productions, I really do love it, especially when someone gives positive feedback on our costumes and sets,"" he said. ""We're called community theatre now, we always used to be called Amdrams, so I think people think the bar is slightly lower than it is.

BBC,0.1139852273145831,IC 814: Netflix show on India plane hijacking sparks row,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clywp741rxwo,,"The series has courted controversy over the aliases used by the hijackers A web series about the 1999 hijacking of an Indian passenger plane has sparked a controversy in the country over the portrayal of some of the characters. Directed by Anubhav Sinha for Netflix, IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack recounts the events surrounding the hijacking of a Kathmandu-Delhi flight which was taken to Taliban-ruled Kandahar to demand the release of militants jailed in India. The controversy over the show, sparked by social media viewers, centred on the hijackers' names in the film. Reports suggest Netflix was summoned by the federal government regarding the issue. The streaming platform has also changed the disclaimer at the beginning of the show. The eight-day hijack ended after a deal between the Indian government and the hijackers, with India releasing three militants, includingMasood Azhar,in exchange for the passengers. India has blamed Azhar, who founded the Jaish-e-Mohammad group after his release, for several attacks in the country. He has also been designated as a terrorist by the United Nations. The decision to release Azhar and others remains controversial in India, with the opposition often criticising the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which was also in power in 1999, for the move. The six-episode mini-series is based on Flight Into Fear: The Captain's Story, a book by Devi Sharan, who captained the hijacked plane, and journalist Srinjoy Chowdhury. The series, which was released last week, begins with the hijackers making their way into the flight at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. Within minutes of take-off, the militants announce the flight - carrying 179 passengers including the five hijackers and 11 crew members - has been hijacked. The series focuses on the interactions between the hijackers, the crew and the passengers, and it also shows Indian government officials working to resolve the crisis. The row began after some social media users criticised the filmmakers for depicting the hijackers calling each other common Hindu names such as Bhola and Shankar, even though their names were Ibrahim Athar, Shahid Akhtar Sayed, Sunny Ahmed Qazi, Mistri Zahoor Ibrahim and Shakir. All of them were from Pakistan. A photo of a Taliban security official receiving a paper on which the hijackers had written their demands BJP leader Amit Malviya said in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that by using the hijackers’ “non-Muslim” aliases in the series, the filmmakers had ensured that people would “think Hindus hijacked IC-814”. A Hindu right-wing organisation has filed a case in a Delhi court seeking a ban on the series. PTI news agency reported that the petition has accused the filmmaker of distorting crucial facts and misrepresenting historical events. Several Indian media outlets, citing sources, reported that the federal government held a meeting with a senior Netflix executive regarding the issue. Netflix and India’s information and broadcasting ministry have not responded to the BBC’s request for comment. The Kandahar Hijack recounts the hijacking of a Kathmandu-Delhi flight diverted to Taliban-ruled Kandahar Many have also defended the series, saying that it is factually accurate. Astatement,externalissued by India’s home ministry in 2000 confirms that the hijackers used such names as aliases to communicate inside and outside the aircraft. “To the passengers of the hijacked place these hijackers came to be known respectively as (1) Chief, (2) Doctor, (3) Burger, (4) Bhola, and (5) Shankar, the names by which the hijackers invariably addressed one another,” the statement said. Witnesses and journalists who reported on the incident have also corroborated this in the past. Kollattu Ravikumar, a survivor of the hijacking who worked as a merchant navy captain for a US-based firm, confirmed the aliases in an article onRediff news portal,externalin 2000. “The four hijackers who were watching over us also had a leader called Berger. It was Berger who used to often shout. As Berger called them, I caught the names of the others - Bola, Shankar and Doctor,” he said. After the row, Netflix issued a statement saying it had updated the disclaimer which appears on screen before the episodes begin. ""For the benefit of audiences unfamiliar with the 1999 hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814, the opening disclaimer has been updated to include the real and code names of the hijackers,"" it said. This isn’t the first time that international streaming platforms have received backlash over content on their platforms in India.

The bankrupt borough council has been working with location agents Area 4 to generate income by renting out assets to the film and entertainment industry. Area 4, the producers behind The Sandman, said they have also used Dukes Court, which will double as a central London police station, and Brookwood Cemetery. The use of the three sites brought in about £89,000 in revenue, according to Area 4.

BBC,0.1139852273145831,Bridgerton and Baby Reindeer drive up Netflix sign-ups,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpwd67gge94o,,"Netflix said it added more than eight million subscribers in the three months to June, reeling in audiences for the new season of Bridgerton and new drama Baby Reindeer. The gain was almost double what investors had predicted, proving the lasting power of the firm's tightened restrictions on password sharing. But the streaming giant warned the impact of the crackdown on sharing passwords may run out in coming months, leading to slower growth in the months ahead. It said it was looking into new areas, such as sports, live events and gaming to extend its lead. Its plans include a multi-player video game tied to the release of a new season of the popular dystopian series Squid Game later this year, as well as offerings linked to shows such as Emily in Paris. ""If we execute well - better stories, easier discovery and more fandom - while also establishing ourselves in newer areas like live, games and advertising, we believe that we have a lot more room to grow,"" the company said to investors. For now, the streaming giant remains the leader to beat for the industry. The gains last quarter brought its total number of subscribers to more than 277 million globally. With more than two people in most households, it estimated that its total audience numbers more than 600 million. In the UK, Netflix's cheapest package, which comes with adverts, costs £4.99. The same deal in the US costs $6.99. Netflix said its ads business was making ""steady progress"", with subscriptions to the plan up 34% in the quarter. But it did not share the total number and warned that the ads business would not start having a meaningful impact on revenue until 2026, noting that for now, subscribers were growing far faster than advertisers. Jamie Lumley, an analyst at Third Bridge, said while Netflix's ad-supported tier continued to be an ""important part of the subscriber growth"", it had ""yet to prove itself from a revenue standpoint"". ""Our experts highlight that Amazon has made a much bigger splash in the ad market and Netflix needs to continue working on scale in this segment if it wants to be a major player,"" he added. Total revenue was $9.56bn, up 17% compared with the same period in 2023, while profits were $2.15bn, compared to $1.5bn a year ago. The firm said it was expecting year-on-year growth of 14% in the July-September period...."
BBC,0.1139852273145831,America's Sweethearts: Life after Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders ,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqv548yny18o,,"Netflix's America’s Sweethearts shows the blood, sweat and tears behind the smiles America’s Sweethearts, which lifts the lid on life in the most famous cheerleading team in the US, has been climbing up the Netflix charts since its release last month. The series follows the gruelling recruitment and coaching process for the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders - DCC for short - and how much pressure the members face to be perfect. Among the hopefuls is 24-year-old Ariana McClure - a medical sales rep who moved to Dallas to pursue her dream. It is her second attempt at making the team, having been cut in training camp the previous year. Dancers have to go through a tough audition process and training camp before they're high-kicking in formation on the football pitch, all without a piece of hair or false eyelash being out of place. It's ruthlessly competitive. As well as learning the demanding acrobatic routines, they are required to stay the same size, so they can continue to fit in to the trademark uniform of tiny shorts, crop top and cowboy boots. The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders performed at Netflix's summer party It’s not the first show about the cheerleaders, who are nicknamed America’s Sweethearts – there had already been 16 seasons of a reality show about the team on US network CMT. But Netflix has brought DCC to a new audience. And many viewers have expressed shock at the demands on the cheerleaders, and the comparatively low wages they are paid. In addition to intense training, most of the women have other full-time jobs. In the opening episode, Cowboys boss Charlotte Jones admits the cheerleaders are ""not paid a lot"" – but says women on the team do not join for the pay, rather to be part of something bigger than themselves. Ariana thinks pay has slightly improved across the board, but still says the cheerleaders should be compensated better. ""I definitely [don’t think we have to earn] anything near what the football players are making,"" she tells the BBC. ""But I do think that these organisations have enough money. ""We like to say it's a part-time job with a full time schedule. Apart from just the hours of practising, it's also two hours beforehand, getting ready, you have to have your hair and make-up done. ""It's also finding time within the day to work out so that you stay in shape, not only physically but to make sure you can get through the routines."" She adds: ""We would all ultimately do it for free because we love it and it's our passion, but it is at the end of the day a job and they treat it as a job and so I think we should be rewarded for our work a little better - but it's getting there."" The series also touches on the mental health of the dancers. Four-year veteran Victoria Kalina – who has since left the team – spoke about struggling with depression and eating disorders while she was on the team. ""I applaud Victoria for being so brave to speak about it because it's a vulnerable thing and it's hard to speak about that and we all have the same thoughts,"" Ariana says. Ariana McClure is now a cheerleader for the Miami Dolphins In order to cope with the pressure of training, Ariana started journalling and seeing a therapist. But she thinks, in order to help others, sports therapists should be offered to cheerleaders on NFL teams. ""My therapist was great, but she's not a dancer, or wasn't an athlete,"" she explains. ""And so having just some tools offered for the girls to talk to would be really beneficial."" A DCC spokesperson told the BBC that all chearleaders, like its football players, have access to ""immediate, independent and confidential support resources"". ""Also, just like our Cowboys players, they have access to our dedicated team Mental Health and Wellness Consultant on staff, as needed."" The women featured in the series have won praise from viewers and TV critics for how they face the exacting expectations. ""America’s Sweethearts is a disturbing show on many levels, but the resilience of its women is impressive,""the Guardian said,external. Emma Beddington wrote that there is ""plenty to horrify"" in the series, including the physical toll on the team members' bodies, the ""abysmal pay"" and ""the objectification"". Time's Judy Berman wrote,external: ""At best, they’re athletes working at the apex of their sport; at worst, they’re casualties of a job market, a form of entertainment, and a society in which misogyny is so deeply ingrained, it’s often enforced by the women it oppresses."" Writing in the New York Times, Jessica Grose said,external: ""If there's another season of the Netflix show, perhaps a more complete picture of the Cowboys cheerleading experience could force this elite institution to evolve, and it may make more of these talented women reach the conclusion that making the team isn't worth the cost."" The show depicts the lows as well as the highs of cheerleading For Ariana, the experience ended when she was cut from training camp on the last day. She says she only found out why she was cut from the team while watching the show ""at the same time as everyone else"". In the emotional chat with director Kelli Finglass and choreographer Judy Trammel, Ari was told she was being dropped because there were only 36 spaces, without much further explanation. But earlier, Jones - the team's executive vice-president and daughter of owner Jerry - had told Kelli and Judy that Ariana looked like a ""little girl"" and ""left behind"" on the team, due to her 5ft 2in (1.57m) height. ""I found out details that I didn't know,"" she tells BBC News. ""And I think it allowed for me to not so much blame myself, not be so hard on myself - knowing it's the one thing God gave me that I can't change or fix."" There are no height restrictions for the team, with guidelines simply saying there are no height or weight requirements, and women are expected to ""look well-proportioned in dancewear"". After watching the show, does Ariana think there should have been a height restriction? ""Had I known even going in the first year that height was a concern, I probably wouldn't have tried out for Cowboys again,"" she says. ""I do think they need to install a height requirement. ""But I also I know that the team changes throughout the years, and the demographic of the team, and they may have more taller rookies, may have shorter rookies."" DCC were asked by the BBC to comment on the team not having a height restriction. But Ariana's hard work hasn't gone to waste - she is about to start the season as a cheerleader for the Miami Dolphins. ""It's nice, because the new director of the Dolphins squad was at the Cowboys, and so I knew her in Dallas for a little bit. ""And so a lot of the things I loved about Cowboys in that organisation, she's taking over to Dolphins - but it is the most mentally positive, happy environment I've been in."" 'We're not less athletic because we wear sparkles'..."

Louie Rudge-Buchanan, 14, of Eyke, Suffolk, has a starring role in The Imaginary, a feature-length fantasy movie from Japanese animation company Studio Ponoc which is now streaming on Netflix. The student, who hoped to become a professional actor, provided the voice of an imaginary friend of a young girl in the film, which is directed by Yoshiyuki Momose who is known for his work with animation giants Studio Ghibli. “It was an absolutely amazing experience and I really enjoyed it,” said Louie, a pupil at Farlingaye High School in Woodbridge. Louie recorded his parts in a studio in London last summer The Imaginary, based on a children’s novel by A.F. Harrold, was released in Japan at the end of last year and rights to the English language version were secured by Netflix, which began streaming the film last week. Louie, who has previously acted in a number of short films, recorded his lines at a studio in London last summer after being chosen for the role when his agent sent a voice recording to the producers. “They had the screen with the film playing and it was quite tough because I had to match up my voice with the mouth movements because it was already pre-animated,” he said. “I was doing it all on my own. Sometimes I'd be lucky to be doing a scene with the other actors talking.” The Imaginary is directed by Yoshiyuki Momose, known for his work with Studio Ghibli The actor had a chance to see the finished film at a private screening in London last month, joined by fellow cast members and his parents James and Ellie. “It was nerve-wracking but it was amazing to see me - well, not really me, but my voice - on the screen. It was probably one of the best feelings I will ever feel,” he said. “It’s an amazing film, it’s an amazing story, everything about it is just amazing - the way it’s made, it’s hand-painted everything.” In the film, Louie’s character Rudger joins his real-life friend, Amanda, on wild and wonderful adventures before being drawn into his own world of “imaginaries”. Louie's mum said the similarity between her son's name and the lead character's was “a happy, strange coincidence”. The Imaginary has received good reviews from film critics upon its release Film critics have given The Imaginary positive reviews. The Daily Telegraph praised its“artistry” and “visionary spark”,externaland The Guardian described it as“a moving and charming testament to the delights of dreaming”,external. “My dream is to just keep it going, keep getting more roles, just keep building my career up,” said Louie.

BBC,0.1139852273145831,Sperm donor Jonathan Jacob Meijer says Netflix documentary is misleading,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c725w322q19o,,"Jonathan Jacob Meijer declined to take part in the docuseries A Dutch sperm donor who fathered hundreds of children has described a new documentary about him as ""misleading"". A Netflix docuseries, released on Wednesday, focuses on the women who have had children using the sperm of Jonathan Jacob Meijer. One woman has said,externalshe felt ""betrayed, sad and angry"" after finding out how many other children Meijer had fathered. But Meijer told the BBC the documentary is deceptive because it gives prominence to those who are unhappy rather than the many families he says are grateful to him. Responding to the interview, its executive producer described the claim that the majority of families are happy as ""completely untrue"". In the interview, Meijer also said he sees ""absolutely nothing wrong"" with fathering hundreds of children. The 43-year-old declined to be interviewed for the Netflix documentary, but hespoke to BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour on Wednesday. ""They deliberately called [the documentary] The Man With 1,000 Kids, when it should be 'the sperm donor who helped families conceive with 550 children',"" he told the programme. ""So already from the start they are deliberately deceiving and misleading."" He continued: ""I think Netflix did a great job at selecting five families [who are unhappy] out of the 225 families that I've helped, and they [the other families] will definitely tell you something else."" Netflix told Woman's Hour it would not comment on Meijer's interview, but Natalie Hill, the documentary's executive producer, did speak to the programme. ""I've spent the last four years speaking to families who have been impacted by Jonathan's lies. I've personally spoken to 45 or 50 families,"" she said. ""Fifty families made impact statements to the court about his lies, and pleaded with the judge that he stop. So this continued platform for Jonathan to talk about it being a handful of women is completely untrue."" Suzanne (left) and Natalie are among the parents who had a child using Meijer's sperm Meijer has been a donor for 17 years. In many cases, he made donations privately, which meant dealing with the families directly rather than via a private clinic. Some women who chose him as a donor say he did not make clear to them the extent of how many other children he had fathered. ""I'm conflicted because he told me back then that he was donating to five families,"" one mother, Natalie, told Woman's Hour. ""It turned out in 2021 I read an article in a newspaper that it was hundreds of families. That's why I'm conflicted and don't agree with his methods."" Some women he has donated to have described him as ""a narcissist"", while others have suggested he represents a public health risk. Asked if he thought his estimate of 550 children was a lot, Meijer said: ""It is for a normal man, but not for a sperm donor. ""For a sperm donor it's quite common. They go up into the hundreds of children. They [the clinics] will ship the donor semen to multiple countries."" The docuseries received extensive coverage ahead of its launch. In a four-star review,the Evening Standard's Vicky Jessup described it,externalas ""a story to chill the blood: a cautionary tale about the perils of the modern age"". ""It’s undoubtedly fascinating viewing, albeit in a very grim way – and the revelations about sperm donation (and Meijer's way of doing it) horrifying,"" she said. The Telegraph's Anita Singh said:,external""The film-makers try too hard to turn this into a Tinder Swindler-style tale of women exacting revenge, and there is a late twist. But even without that it’s a decent tale that prompts bigger questions about the donor industry."" Some women have expressed concerns that their child may unknowingly meet and get into a relationship with a half-sibling in the future. Mother Natalie said: ""The biggest concern is that these children are going to run into one another, and fall in love with one another, because they recognise something in each other and they're not aware of the fact that they're from the same donor dad. ""That's the biggest risk I see, because he talks about being an open and known donor, but he has donated to numerous clinics around the globe, and not all the clinics share the same values about being open and honest towards children."" Meijer pushed back on this suggestion, telling presenter Nuala McGovern the concern was based on cases where anonymous donors had been used, whereas his identity was easily available. ""I can guarantee you that, now there are cheap DNA tests, and I am on the DNA database, so they can find out,"" he said. ""Also, the parents will tell their children they are from a donor. So because they all know my identity, even if the chance happens that they would meet each other, they can simply ask, 'Are you a donor child?', and secondly, 'Is your donor father Jonathan?' ""These outdated views, we should stop projecting them on these children. They are very aware they are a donor child. They know how to respond."" Meijer was banned from donating sperm in the Netherlands in 2017,externalafter it emerged he was the father of 102 children, born from donations made to 11 clinics around the country. He continued donating in other countries until 2023, when one woman and a foundation supporting her filed a civil suit against Meijer, arguing he was increasing the risk of incest for his children. In his testimony, Meijer admitted having between 550 and 600 children. However, the court said he may have fathered up to 1,000 across several continents. The judge ultimately banned Meijer from donating sperm to new parents, and said he would be fined 100,000 euros (£85,000) per donation if he did so. Meijer told Woman's Hour: ""I already stopped donating for new recipients in 2019. I only donated for siblings. The court case was basically useless because I already stopped, and the court case did not prohibit me to help existing families."" Asked if he saw any problem with his actions, Meijer said: ""I see absolutely nothing wrong with it. I think it's very good. I see that they [the children] have many friends, they meet with each other. ""And I cannot speak for them, but from what I've seen, they are very happy that they have so many siblings. Because they [the half-siblings] meet on donor days, they meet with each other and go on holiday together."" Discussing his reasons for becoming a sperm donor, Meijer said: ""The misconception is I had some sort of plan. Basically I was in college and there was a friend of mine who was infertile. ""It had a big impact on me, because I saw the effect that it had on his life. So I started to be interested... and I started to think, could I be a donor?"" When McGovern asked if Meijer understood the way the women felt, he said: ""Why should they be uncomfortable? It's what they chose. ""If you want exclusivity, you go to the clinic, you pay 10,000 euros and then your donor is exclusive. If you don't want to share as a mother, why did you choose this path?"" Defending the docu-series, Hill told Woman's Hour: ""The documentary series, which we've spent a long time making and researching carefully, has comments and research from multiple families all across the world. And to suggest that he knows all these families and that they're all happy is not true. ""In the series, you can see how Jonathan has been able to lie with the lack of legal landscape and the lack of transparency in fertility overall. And the consequences to the families is really well brought out in the documentary series."" In a statement,the UK's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) said,externalthe Netflix series ""may be stressful and upsetting for the families of some donor-conceived children"". Speaking to Radio 4, Rachel Cutting, director of compliance and information at the HFEA, added: ""Fertility treatment in the UK is very regulated, and that isn't always the case globally... Within the UK, we have a 10-family limit. ""But what can happen is donors can donate outside the UK, so while we have control in the UK, the HFEA does not have any jurisdiction outside the UK, or what happens with private donations, which is why we encourage women to go to a licensed HFEA clinic.""..."

Tubi will compete with the likes of Netflix, Disney+, ITVX and Channel 4's streaming platform as well as the BBC iPlayer. The platform has been quickly gaining market share in the US where, according to Fox, it has almost 80 million monthly active users. In the UK, Tubi says it will launch with more than 20,000 films and TV series, including content from Disney, Lionsgate, NBCUniversal and Sony Pictures Entertainment. The platform will also include a selection of British,Indian and Nigerian content. UK viewers will be able to access content on the Tubi webpage, via a smartphone app and on smart TVs. “Tubi has spent the last decade honing our approach to vast, free and fun streaming in North America, and we feel that now is the perfect time to bring that recipe to UK audiences,” Tubi chief executive Anjali Sud said. Fox Corporation bought Tubi in 2020 for $440m (£348m) as the US media giant looked to attract younger audiences. Netflix profits soar after password crackdown Disney says password crackdown will increase subscribers In recent years, streaming companies like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ have launched ad-supported services and raised subscription prices as they tried to boost revenues. The moves came as they faced pressure to spend more money to grow their libraries of content as they try to attract more customers in an increasingly competitive market. Abi Watson, senior media analyst at Enders, told the BBC that while Tubi had ""been very successful in the US"" the UK was a ""very different media environment"". ""It is already well-catered for in the free online video space as the public service broadcasters have invested heavily,"" she added. She said a service with ""little or no unique content"" such as Tubi could find it difficult to gain traction - although efforts by foreign operators to break into the UK's free video streaming market had ""so far been half-hearted"". In March, Mr Murdoch's TalkTV network announced that it would stop broadcasting as a terrestrial television channel and became a strictly online service. The network launched in 2022 but struggled to attract viewers on its linear platform. Mr Murdoch had hoped the network would shake up the broadcasting establishment by offering an opinion-led alternative to established outlets. The media tycoon played a pivotal role in the development of the UK's  broadcasting industry by launching Sky in 1984. Some commentators saw TalkTV as an attempt by Mr Murdoch to recreate his success with Sky.

BBC,0.1139852273145831,Baby Reindeer: Woman sues Netflix for $170m over Martha character,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c6ppe84jq6do,,"Fiona Harvey appeared on Piers Morgan Uncensored following claims that she inspired the character of Martha A Scottish woman who allegedly inspired the stalker character Martha in hit Netflix drama Baby Reindeer is suing the streamer for defamation, negligence and privacy violations. Fiona Harvey - who has identified herself as the woman on whom Martha is based - argued in a lawsuit that Netflix told ""brutal lies"" about her to over 50 million viewers around the world. The lawsuit, filed in a California court, seeks over $170m (£132m) in damages for Ms Harvey. She claims the Baby Reindeer series falsely depicted her as a convicted criminal who spent time in prison for stalking. Netflix has vowed to ""defend this matter vigorously"". It said it would stand by the right of the show's creator and star, Scottish comedian Richard Gadd, to ""tell his story"". Mr Gadd wrote the series about his alleged experience of being stalked by a woman he met at the pub where he worked. He has previously appealed to fans to refrain from trying to identify Martha, a character who he first described in a stand-up comedy routine. He is not named as a defendant in Ms Harvey's lawsuit. The first episode of the hit mini-series claims that ""this is a true story"". The show's end credits say that the programme ""is based on real events: however certain characters, names, incidents, locations, and dialogue have been fictionalized for dramatic purposes”. Neither Mr Gadd nor Ms Harvey's real names are used in the series, and neither Netflix or Mr Gadd have confirmed that Martha was based on Ms Harvey. While giving evidence before the Culture Media and Sport Committee in Parliament last month, Netflix executive Benjamin King said the show was ""obviously a true story of the horrific abuse that the writer and protagonist Richard Gadd suffered at the hands of a convicted stalker"". Mr King was subsequently challenged by an MP - the SNP's John Nicolson - to substantiate his statements. Mr Nicolson said ""journalists can find no evidence to back up the Netflix claim"" of a conviction for the woman identified as the inspiration for Martha. For her part, Ms Harvey alleges in her case that Netflix ""did literally nothing"" to confirm that Mr Gadd's story was true. Ms Harvey also denies that she sexually assaulted the show's creator, according to the court documents, which allege that Netflix “told these lies, and never stopped, because it was a better story than the truth, and better stories made money”. In one scene in the series, the Martha character is depicted as sexually assaulting the show's protagonist along a canal one night. The Baby Reindeer fallout: What will happen next in 2024's biggest TV controversy? Baby Reindeer 'a big problem' for Netflix and Gadd - Morgan. Video, 00:00:48Baby Reindeer 'a big problem' for Netflix and Gadd - Morgan Ms Harvey told BBC News on Thursday that she was certain her team would win the case. ""Otherwise, we wouldn't be doing it,"" she said. Richard Roth, a New York-based lawyer representing Ms Harvey, told the BBC there was ""no doubt"" that Ms Harvey's identity was used for Baby Reindeer's plot. He said he had ""incontrovertible documentary evidence” proving that his client had never been convicted of a crime. The lawsuit includes a photo of a background check and a certificate that claims that Ms Harvey has no criminal convictions on her record. Ms Harvey, who lives in the UK, says that since the series was released in April she has received numerous death threats. The experience has left her ""fearful of leaving her home or checking the news"", the lawsuits says, adding that she has ""become extremely secluded and isolated, in fear of the public, going days without leaving her home"". In a nearly hour-long interview with Piers Morgan last month, Ms Harvey confirmed that she had known Mr Gadd during his time working at a pub in London. But she denied that she had acted like the character Martha, who sends Mr Gadd's character 41,000 emails and leaves 350 hours of voicemail messages in the show. ""None of that's true. I don't think I sent him anything,"" she said. ""No, I think there may have been a couple of emails exchanged, but that was it. Just jokey banter emails."" The lawsuit does say, however, that some real comments she made to Mr Gadd -  such as a tweet she sent him in 2014 - are used in the show's dialogue...."
