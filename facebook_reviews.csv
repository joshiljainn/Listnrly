0760dc85-7fab-4171-85bf-6b04b4c17abf,Michael Knight,Ok so yes Netflix is pretty good however I'm a little disappointed that since getting it a year and a half ago the price for my plan was 15.99 the it became 16.49 and now just the other day it's going up to 18.99 in less than 2 years. With over 1 billion members and a share price over $1000 per share I'm disappointed that it's come to this. Amazon Prime is $99 a year and I'm considering dropping this service from lack of new content.,3,1,9.2.1 build 9 62116,2025-02-19 23:12:09,9.2.1 build 9 62116

It supports up to 4K HDR, but occasional autoplay and subtitle bugs persist. Not all content is available for offline download, which can be limiting. Improvements should include better search filters, smarter recommendations, and long-term licensing.

01812e62-ed91-4af3-a397-68d87dc9b8b5,Chris,A once great app that Netflix long ago ceased to care about. Quality & volume of content has been in decline for years. The app itself gets worse every year or so and the descriptions of the shows betray how little Netflix cares as the description of many don't even tell you what the movie is about anymore simply saying movie stars X actor or Y person said it was good. If even Netflix doesn't care enough about their content to tell you what it is then that's a pretty damning indictment.,1,66,8.105.0 build 15 50626,2025-01-11 11:23:57,8.105.0 build 15 50626

But they've changed it so that all your accounts MUST be used at the same address or they lock up your login forcing you to use two factor authentication and tell them why you're logging in from somewhere else. If im PAYING for multiple profiles I should be able to have them logged in ANYWHERE. Yet another reason to switch streaming services.,1,110,8.140.1 build 14 51170,2024-12-08 11:19:15,8.140.1 build 14 51170

There is no way to tell if you have already watched the movie before. This is so confusion especially when Netflix keeps changing the same movie covers with different versions of the same movie. This is the case regardless of the movie in your selection or not. 2. Why keep changing movie cover pictures? Who are they trying to trick into watching the same movie unknowingly ?? 3.

They claimed first that Netflix doesn't support AC3, which is patently untrue, since my Apple TV does so perfectly with its Netflix app. Then they claimed it is Google's fault, which it isn't (Chromecast + GTV has the options to support AC3) They are simply too lazy to program in support for the stream they make available for other devices.

55d25b7a-4277-462c-99ca-c05c4f6987ef,TE5LA,"This review is more about the overall service than the app. Netflix prices have increased so many times since I've been a customer, it has nearly doubled. For awhile, I cannot find anything on the service to watch, there just isn't enough variety. Amazon has 5 times the movies and more TV shows and streaming speeds are 3-5 times faster than Netflix. Amazon is $50/yr. less than Netflix and you get free 2-day shipping and music cloud storage as well. Regarding the app, it is poorly laid out. A gigantic banner that promotes just one movie wastes about 30% of your screen. The sections duplicate too many titles and the ""Continue Watching"" section keeps too many titles you've already seen. Also, if a movie was started and you watched only 10-15 minutes because you didn't like it, it should be removed after a certain amount of time. This section often contains shows I've never even started. The frequent interruptions of ""Are you still watching?"" messages are annoying. Why do these appear during the show instead of before or after an episode? It makes no sense. Having individual viewing accounts is good but why do i have to select it every time if I'm the only one viewing content on my TV? There should be a cookie to save this choice but allow you the option of changing it. There should be an option to filter out non-English language movies.
