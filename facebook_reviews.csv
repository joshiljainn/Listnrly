0760dc85-7fab-4171-85bf-6b04b4c17abf,Michael Knight,Ok so yes Netflix is pretty good however I'm a little disappointed that since getting it a year and a half ago the price for my plan was 15.99 the it became 16.49 and now just the other day it's going up to 18.99 in less than 2 years. With over 1 billion members and a share price over $1000 per share I'm disappointed that it's come to this. Amazon Prime is $99 a year and I'm considering dropping this service from lack of new content.,3,1,9.2.1 build 9 62116,2025-02-19 23:12:09,9.2.1 build 9 62116

Nowadays it's 90% teenage drama slop, celebrity bait, or reality TV. 99% of all the good shows have either had their full run or (for the most part) cancelled. Netflix could work with big name directors (such as David Lynch rip) to make their dream series, instead they use machine learned patterns to keep their audience satiated. It's sad to see.

I have trouble getting episodes to load on my tvs or phones. sometimes it freezes on my tv and then my TV restarted back to my home screen. No other apps do this.

d1dc47bd-ee59-4485-815e-a60eb2b80d3a,Ana Gonzalez,I have been a loyal customer for Netflix for many years. I had the basic plan. They cancelled it. I didn't want to sign up again but after three months I decided to try the adds plan. It turns out you cannot even stream. So I cancelled it. Good riddance Netflix.,1,18,8.129.0 build 5 50801,2024-08-31 07:08:29,8.129.0 build 5 50801
eb24b8a1-42dd-4cd6-8153-14bb8660be9e,Brenton Hodge,The algorithm makes for boring choices..I don't want to watch 6 different versions of the same show. At least spotify can give me 6 unique play lists. Netflix choices are funnelled without creativity. I want variety..this is really annoying and I can't find anything to watch because I feel like I've watched it already. And for God sake remove things I've watched. Get it sorted..im going to prime.,3,48,8.129.0 build 5 50801,2024-08-30 16:19:10,8.129.0 build 5 50801

The issue arises when I click on any movie, drama etc, my screen FREEZES just at the loading sign (before the video starts playing) but the audio WORKS perfectly well (since you can hear the video being continued by the audio). This also takes up a lot of time to exit since it also freezes my tablet for around 5 minutes",4,674,8.129.0 build 5 50801,2024-08-30 08:31:59,8.129.0 build 5 50801

I got it through my phone carrier plan, but would pay for it. Tons of variety of whatever you want to watch. Other countries make good movies, but I hate to read them, because then you may miss something that is going on with the show, so Netflix has a lot of movies from other countries that are dubbed in English, so i get to enjoy.",5,5483,8.126.0 build 9 50771,2024-08-23 06:37:42,8.126.0 build 9 50771
546565dd-81f1-49b3-a8c9-f1307fce1cc4,Christopher Barry,"Not a bad app... definitely better than some others. One very helpful function I'd like to see added... on your ""Continue Watching"" row, when you tap the three dots and it brings up a menu, please add the option to ""share"" from there. This saves having to do a search for what you want to share only just to be able to share it. Also, if I only have one profile on the app, why do I need to keep choosing it? The app should start and go right to the main screen without having to tap my profile.",4,518,8.126.0 build 9 50771,2024-08-22 05:21:57,8.126.0 build 9 50771

I don't want to watch a preview for something else 3 seconds after I just finished something. And while you're at it, just because I turned off previews on the home screen, that doesn't mean I want something to start playing just because I select it to look at the details or add it to my list. If I want to watch something, I'll press play. I don't need you doing it for me.",1,305,8.128.0 build 5 50793,2024-08-21 00:13:55,8.128.0 build 5 50793
