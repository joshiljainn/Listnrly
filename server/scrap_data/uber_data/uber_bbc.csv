BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber licensed to operate in 'tough' Oxford city market,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqlyddw6zn0o,,"Uber connects passengers to drivers via an app which uses GPS technology Taxi app giant Uber has been given a licence to operate in Oxford and its surrounding areas. The firm launched its service on Wednesday after Oxford City Council said it ""found no reason to refuse the application"". The company said it was ""delighted"" to be launching in ""one of the UK's most iconic cities"". But some private hire and black cab drivers in Oxford have said that Uber may struggle to succeed in the city. Sajad Khan, secretary of the City of Oxford Licenced Taxicab Association, said the company faced a ""challenge"" operating in Oxford. ""Oxford is a small city to be honest and the work is dependent a lot on students,"" he explained. ""If students are away it gets very quiet."" He added: ""Our trade is going through a bad patch since Covid. ""This includes people working from home, financial difficulties, not many people coming off the train station - which is the main rank for us. ""So at the moment the situation is tough out there."" Private hire and black cab drivers have suggested Uber may struggle in Oxford He said while Uber's move into Oxford could be a ""concern"", it also contradicted council strategies to reduce traffic and harmful emissions. ""I'm not sure how this will help the local authority... more cars are going to be introduced to Oxford,"" he said. Uber said it understood Oxford was ""heavily focussed on congestion"", and that enabling people to book an Uber rather than driving was ""important"". ""Uber has operated in London for many years, which is also focussed on important issues such as congestion and Electric Vehicles (EVs), with London now Uber's global leading city for EVs,"" it said. Oxford City Council said the application was reviewed ""against the same criteria as all other private hire operators in the city"". An Uber spokesperson said it would be providing ""new earning opportunities for local drivers, give passengers greater transport options and support the local economy"". It said: ""Uber's industry leading safety features will give passengers the ability to book safe trips to wherever they want to go, in particular the city's students and tourists."" Uber also claimed it had ""well over 100"" drivers, and expected that to increase in the coming weeks. In a statement Oxford City Council said: ""A new operator will give residents and visitors more options for moving around the city safely and conveniently."" Uber connects passengers to drivers via an app which uses GPS technology to locate available taxis. It has launched in other UK cities over the past year, includingAberdeenandYork. Taxi drivers previously protested in Oxfordwhen Uber launched a local cab trial in 2021. Do you have a story BBC Oxfordshire should cover?

Uber and Bolt drivers strike on Valentine's Day 'Impossible' to make ends meet, Uber drivers say Taxi drivers protest over Uber arrival in Oxford Uber accused of 'back door' taxi plan Oxford City Council..."
BBC,0.05855610077732243,"Uber, Bolt and Addison Lee drivers strike on Valentine's Day",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g7189x9wno,,"Thousands of Uber, Bolt and Addison Lee drivers are logging off during peak hours on Valentine's Day in a campaign for better pay and working conditions, a union says. The strike action is taking place across the UK from 16:00 to 22:00 GMT. The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said it would unite ""drivers up and down the country faced with low pay and insecure conditions"". Uber, Bolt and Addison and Lee have defended their working conditions after the IWGB said drivers in cities including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff and Brighton were backing the strike. Vasilica Dumitrescu has been working for various platforms, including Uber and Bolt, for the last nine years. The 51-year-old said she works seven days a week, clocking up more than 80 hours, just to make ends meet. ""It's really bad financially, emotionally physically, everything,"" Ms Dumitrescu said. ""I can't afford to make bills, rent, food, which is so expensive now. It's really, really bad."" Vasilica Dumitrescu is taking part in the strike Ms Dumitrescu said she hopes the strike leads to higher pay agreements. ""The customers, they are with us,"" she added. ""Every driver is upset because they don't earn enough. They ask you how much you get from this trip and are surprised at how little we get."" An Uber spokesperson said all its drivers are guaranteed to earn at least the national living wage, and that the majority can and do earn more. ""On average, drivers across the UK earn more than £30 per hour when taking trips on Uber,"" the spokesperson said. ""They also have access to industry-leading protections such as holiday pay, a pension and free sickness and injury cover, as well as formal representation through GMB Union."" A spokesperson for Bolt said the company was ""committed to ensuring our prices balance the earning needs of drivers with affordability for passengers"". ""All drivers receive holiday pay and monetary supplements to ensure they earn at least the national living wage, alongside a pension,"" the spokesperson added. Just over an hour into the strike, a Bolt spokesperson said service levels were ""unaffected"" and users were ""able to book rides as normal"". Addison Lee has been contacted for comment. The company previously told the PA news agency: ""We have a close working relationship with our drivers, which was further reinforced in our recent bi-annual driver satisfaction survey. We do not expect to see any disruption to volumes or service levels on February 14."" In September 2024,Bolt drivers won a claim against the companyafter an employment tribunal ruled they were ""workers"" under UK law and entitled to rights and protections, including the national minimum wage. In January 2025, Addison Lee drivers won a similar case. Helio Santos, who is based in Stratford in east London, is another driver taking part in the strike. He has been driving with Uber for three years and said that while he spent 70 to 80 hours per week online, that often translates to just 25 to 30 hours of driving. Mr Santos said that Friday's strike action shows that drivers across UK are ""reaching a breaking point"". ""This is unsustainable,"" he said. ""Fees are too low, there is no safety, no transparency. Uber keeps ignoring us."" Helio Santos has been driving with Uber for three years Mr Santos, who has three children including a four-year-old, said Uber's promise of the national living wage was ""meaningless"". ""It is mocking us, saying drivers get a living wage. I'll be better off working for a cleaning company,"" he added. The IWGB said that since drivers became ""workers"" under the law, they have reported their conditions have worsened. Alongside demands for fairer pay and more secure work, the union is calling for the introduction of safety measures for drivers such as rider ID verification, complaint tracking systems, and support for victims of assault. A spokesperson for Bolt said the company has committed €100m (£83.3m) over the next three years to support safety initiatives for its drivers. In recent years, it has introduced an in-app emergency assist button and provided additional passenger information prior to pick-up, the spokesperson added. Part of Friday's action will include a vigil for Bolt driverGabriel Bringye who was killed in Tottenham, north London, in 2021. Mr Bringye, 37, was set upon by a group of teenagers on a crime spree, who booked the cab with the sole intention of robbing the driver. The IWGB said the vigil marks four years since his death, and that drivers are demanding better protections in his name.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,"'Impossible' to make ends meet, Uber drivers say",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1elg0267p6o,,"Drivers working for the taxi platform in Bristol have spoken out about the working conditions they face Standing together in the cold on one of Bristol's busiest streets, driver after driver comes forward to tell us how ""impossible"" it has become to make a living working for Uber. Saadane Saker, 48, has more than 20 years experience as a taxi driver in Bristol - six of them with Uber. ""Life is really tough out there, everything has gone up,"" he said. ""To earn what you used to back in the day, you're not going to get it, because the fares are really low. ""What you end up doing instead is working too many hours, most of the drivers out there have got kids and families."" Uber has strongly refuted these claims, saying drivers earn at least a National Living Wage when giving lifts and that they had access to ""industry leading worker rights"". Mr Saker said some fares were lower than those he had seen decades earlier When Uber arrived in the city, it was ""brilliant, good money, nice driving, fancy cars - a happy life,"" said Daniel Pop, who has been an Uber driver since 2016. But for Mr Pop, and many drivers like him, that wasn't to last. ""After the pandemic, when everything started to recover and all the prices went up, Uber prices were the same or even lower than before the pandemic,"" he said. ""Insurance went up, fuel went up, cost of living went up, and we still have to survive on the same amount of money as before."" It is a story we hear again and again. The promise (for some, in the early days, the reality) of supporting families and fledgling businesses with a flexible income, replaced with a growing anxiety about working hours, opaque commission rates and the ever-present financial pressure. Mr Pop explained how drivers have struggled to meet rising costs of living When we put these concerns to Uber a spokesperson said: ""All drivers are guaranteed to earn at least the national living wage when taking trips, with Uber topping up earnings if they ever fall below this level, but the vast majority of drivers can and do earn much more."" They added that they ""definitely recognise"" rising insurance and fuel costs, but said drivers ""are earning more since 2021 when we introduced holiday pay, pensions and the national living wage guarantee"". It is important to note that ""taking trips"" only represents a percentage of a driver's day. ""You could be ten hours online and have five hour's trips, but the other five hours where you didn't do any trips is dead time - zero money, zero earnings,"" said Mr Pop. Drivers told us it was now much harder to make a living working for the platform Even after just four years with Uber, Cosmin Caraba, 38, said he has seen a huge change in his experience with the platform. He told us he started working four days a week, eight to 10 hours a day, but now makes the ""same money"" working 12 hour days, five days a week. ""It is impossible today to work five days and to be able to pay your car, your insurance, your maintenance and then to take some profit home to pay for things and live a normal life, like normal people,"" he said. ""This is all we're looking for, a normal life,"" he explained. An Uber spokesperson said drivers ""have access to industry leading worker rights such as a pension and holiday pay, and refuted claims that drivers were working shifts as long as 12 hours, saying for ""safety reasons"" drivers were not allowed to drive on the app for more than 10 hours in any one go. Mr Caraba also described Uber's claim that drivers could work casually for extra money as a ""big lie"", citing the mounting costs of running a car. Bristol City Council requires drivers to use a car no more three-and-a-half years old - leaving many drivers with no choice but to buy new vehicles on expensive finance agreements. A spokesperson said the council's ""priority"" was to ensure customers travelling in a vehicle licensed by the authority had a ""safe and fair journey"". Mr Caraba said it was ""impossible"" to earn enough to live ""a normal life"" through the platform All of the drivers we spoke to said they had seen an increase in the commission Uber takes per ride. Drivers are not shown how much a rider has paid for a journey - only what they earn from it, and are barred from asking a rider how much they have paid. They are given a weekly percentage figure through the app, showing how much Uber has taken in commission, but there are concerns about transparency when this information isn't provided trip-by-trip. Mr Saker said when the app first came to the city the maximum commission taken by Uber was 20%, rising to 25% ""a year or two later"". But ""drivers speak to each other"" he said, which had led to them discovering commission rates of up to 41%. During our interview we ran a short experiment to see this for ourselves, using a phone to hail a short journey in the city centre and watching the request come in to eight drivers' phones. As riders we were quoted £7.90 for the trip, but the Uber drivers were offered as low as £4.70 for doing the job - a commission rate of around 47%. This video can not be played Video shows differing rates Uber drivers are offered Uber drivers do not know what riders pay for each trip, and told us they are barred from asking their customers directly how much they paid. An Uber spokesperson said commission rates like these were ""not the case when averaged out over the week"". They added that when Uber became a ""merchant operator"" in the UK they moved from a fixed ""service fee"" of 25% to a variable amount. ""It is correct that on some trips the amount kept by Uber can be slightly higher than before, but on other trips it can now be lower than 25% or even 0% in order to increase the chances of matching the trip,"" they said. In addition, they said ""on average"" the amount kept by Uber had ""remained stable for many years"", but that this did vary ""from one driver to another based on they types of trips they took"". The future is uncertain for many of Bristol's Uber drivers. We heard repeatedly that they could not see themselves remaining in the industry long-term, but were worried about their future job prospects elsewhere. So where do they go now? Instead of retreating from the platform, many drivers told us they are pushing the worldwide company to change. Fellow driver Nadeem Butt told us: ""Uber should know that Uber is nothing without the drivers. It's just an app - but they don't care."" While driving might seem like a solitary occupation, drivers are in constant communication with each other - becoming increasingly organised. As we wrap up our interview, Mr Saker has one thing left to say. ""We are together. Strength comes with unity.""

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber probed by US consumer watchdog over subscription plan,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xp0enrkl8o,,"The ride-hailing giant says it received inquiries about Uber One's cancellation procedures Uber is facing an investigation by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) into its flagship subscription plan, the company has said. As first reported by Bloomberg, the US consumer watchdog was probing the ride-hailing giant over the enrolment and cancellation procedures of the service. Uber One, which has more than 25 million subscribers around the world, offers fee-paying members discounts on rides and deliveries. The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BBC News. “We will continue to answer any questions the FTC may have about our cancellation policies,” said an Uber spokesperson. “The Uber One cancellation process follows both the letter and the spirit of the law: Uber One members can easily cancel their membership in the app - in fact, the majority of those cancellations take 20 seconds or less.” The FTC contacted Uber with a proposal for settling the investigation and the company has since written back with a counter offer. Other technology giants, including Adobe and Apple, have faced lawsuits from the FTC over cancellation policies that the regulator deemed overly complicated. Those claims have been disputed by the companies. Last month, the FTC finalised a'click to cancel' rule, which aims to make it easier for people to end subscriptions. The new regulations, which have been challenged by some business groups, would force companies to make subscription sign-ups and cancellations equally straightforward. A law introduced in the UK in May also takes aim at so-called subscriptions traps. The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 requires businesses to provide clear information to consumers before they enter a subscription agreement. It forces sellers to remind customers that a free or low-cost trial is coming to an end. It also requires companies to ensure customers can easily end a contract.

The firm will be able to hire 160 drivers in the city following the licence approval from Plymouth City Council on Thursday.

The city council said Plymouth needed more taxis and some people in the city welcomed the decision. Ben Wildman is managing director of Easy Cars in Plymouth Ben Wildman left the Royal Navy four years ago to set up Easy Cars where he now employs 38 drivers. He said Uber's move into Plymouth could be ""devastating"" for his family firm which he runs with his brother and parents.

The Newcastle drivers, who do not have formal union representation, gathered to protest outside the company's office by the Bigg Market. Changes made by Uber followinga Supreme Court judgement in 2021mean drivers no longer know how much a customer has paid, only their own fee, which they say is ""unfair"". Uber has been approached for comment. The court ruled Uber drivers should be considered employees, meaning they would be entitled to minimum wage and holiday pay. At the time, drivers would take payment from customers and pay the firm a set 25% fee. Uber has now changed this process to handle payments itself, forwarding a fee to drivers, who have complained there is no transparency over what share they receive. Abdul Khan, 35, from Fenham, who joined the protest on Tuesday, said he had been driving for Uber for two years but ""didn’t get paid enough"" and he felt that ""this is going to happen again this year"". He said he spent between 12 and 13 hours a day either working or waiting for fares. ""People can't take home even £100 - if they do, it's only going to pay for fuel,"" he said. Driver Mohammed Rahman said customers are also getting a bad deal Mohammed Rahman, 31, has been an Uber driver for five years and said drivers and customers are getting a bad deal. ""We've seen a lot of customers paying double, triple the fare,"" he said. ""For example, if we take a 10-mile job, that might give us £7 or £8, but customers are paying £20 or £30. ""They don't show us anymore what they're charging - just what we'll make and I don't think that’s fair."" Newcastle City Council said while it has no jurisdiction over Uber’s relationship with its drivers, it was aware of their concerns.

Uber recently started operating in Blackpool and its drivers have reportedly been charging as little as 36p for a two-mile trip. Driver Neil Charnock, who campaigns for taxi licensing laws to be tightened, said: ""This company cannot and should not be allowed to cause such damage to fragile economies like Blackpool."" Uber said it was normal practice to offer discounts to passengers for their first few journeys in one of the company's new towns. Uber was granted a licence by Blackpool Council in August, although some of its drivers - licensed by other councils - had already been plying for trade in the resort. Mr Charnock said people would be ""astounded to hear of the fares Uber are charging"". He added: ""I have heard of fares such as 36p from the town centre to the Hampton by Hilton Hotel near the Pleasure Beach, and 9p from Fleetwood to the college at Ashfield Road. ""Students are hiring Ubers to college as they are cheaper than buses. ""If the young people of today are choosing rideshare apps ahead of local buses, this will mean significantly more congestion, [longer] journey times and ultimately losses to Blackpool Transport."" Bill Lewtas, secretary of the Blackpool Taxi Association, said Uber was using a loss-leader pricing strategy to attract passengers. But he predicted promotional fares would soon end and warned: ""When Uber bring in their surge prices, they charge considerably more than us."" Uber said it was supporting Blackpool’s economy by meeting unmet demand. ""Promotional offers such as £5 off your first trip may well explain the 36p trip,"" a company spokesman said. Discounts are funded by Uber, with the driver being paid the normal fare...."

Plymouth City Council said its Taxi Licensing Committee would review applications from Uber and Smartzi on 21 November. Uber has applied for a five-year licence in the city and a fleet of 160 vehicles per year, while Smartzi applied in March for a five-year licence for one vehicle per year. Councillor Sally Haydon, cabinet member for community safety, said the authority was ""acutely aware"" a decision to grant a licence to either firm would have consequences for existing trade, but the move could also help clubs, bars and other venues. Officers from the council have asked the committee whether the directors of Uber and Smartzi are considered fit and proper persons to be granted a Private Hire Vehicle Operator's Licence. The council said any decision would be made based on its taxi licensing policy and if the applications meet it criteria.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber drivers protest in Glasgow over 'unfair' pay and working conditions,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj9jdyzzdgvo,,"Naveed Akhtar and Amir Humza say they are getting a smaller fraction of private hire fares Uber drivers have protested outside the company's hub in Glasgow to demand better pay and job protection. The drivers said their wages had plummeted in the last year despite prices rising for customers, and the company took an unfair slice of the fare. GMB Scotland, representing the workers, said it was unclear how the company calculated fares and wages and it did not take increased fuel and insurance costs into account. Uber said its drivers were guaranteed the National Living Wage and it regularly engaged with workers through the union. A survey of members by the GMB revealed only one in five drivers was earning more now compared to a year ago. Uber uses surge pricing, where fares rise when demand is higher, and drivers said the company must be more transparent about the system to ensure the increased revenue is fairly shared with them. Amir Humza, 27, has been working for Uber in Glasgow for a over a year and says job rates are getting lower ""day by day"". ""Every week it slowly goes down by a few margins rather than up and expenses are getting higher,"" he said. The Uber drivers marched down Washington Street in Anderston ""For an airport job, about nine miles from the city centre, you're only getting about £11 but when you speak to the customers, they're charging them around £25. ""And then there's no guarantee you'll get a hire back because it's out the city zone. It's not worth the mileage we're doing for it - it's a bit like slave labour to be honest."" He added: ""They just take their percentage and we don't know what the customer is paying, they just offer us a price. ""Some drivers take all the rubbish jobs as well because they'd rather do that than sit about so the rates go down more and more."" He also raised concerns with the new dashboard system, which offers drivers new trips while they have passengers from an ongoing job. ""Normally if they offer you a job, you've got a couple of seconds to accept it and so you're losing concentration on the road as you're driving,"" he said. ""Other drivers are desperate to make money so you have to act quick to get it and it could be dangerous."" Ewa Zezula-wozniczka said some trips were not worth the mileage Ewa Zezula-wozniczka, a GMB union representative, said drivers were struggling to earn enough to cover their expenses, including insurance and petrol. ""Everything went up and our income shrank,"" she told BBC Scotland News. ""We respect our passengers and we would totally love to have every single passenger onboard and take them. ""But we also need to think about our families, our income and how we’ll pay the bills to be able to sustain ourselves."" Vini Sharma said he had to take on other work recently Glasgow driver Vini Sharma said he had been forced to take on other work as his Uber wages were not enough. ""Everything has gone up, I recently paid £390 for my insurance last month,"" he said. ""Inflation is high, petrol has gone up - and the job prices are just not fair."" Gerry Mcilveen, 58, has worked for the company in Glasgow since 2016 - but he has spent nearly 20 years driving private hires.

""The company is making a lot of money, but we're the ones out on the street doing the work."" Veteran driver Gerry Mcilveen said drivers were taking home less Mr Mcilveen, who is also a union representative for the Glasgow drivers, said Uber needed to improve how it dealt with suspended drivers. ""A lot of people are being suspended and then they are left without work for weeks,"" he said. ""They've got no other work to go to apart from going to other companies. ""It's not right. If they've got an issue, they should take you in and deal with it. Often it's difficult to actually speak to someone about what's going on."" An Uber spokesperson said: ""All drivers on Uber are guaranteed holiday pay, access to a pension plan, free sickness protection and guaranteed National Living Wage – though the vast majority earn more.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,"Wait a few more minutes for an electric Uber, says boss",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm29j4kx4vmo,,"People waiting for an Uber should be patient enough to wait a few minutes longer for an electric car, the boss of the ride-hailing firm has said. ""A couple of minutes isn't going to kill anyone,"" Dara Khosrowshahi told the BBC in an interview. Uber is rolling out new options to encourage customers to choose electric rides, but at the same time he says governments should be doing more to support sales of electric vehicles (EVs). Cheaper, Chinese-made electric vehicles are also ""good for the environment"" he said. Despite that, many countries are pushing back against the import of Chinese EVs because they see them as unfair competition for domestic carmakers. ""High quality"" Chinese-made EVs are part of the solution to the climate crisis, Mr Khosrowshahi said. He also called on the new UK government to stick to its pre-election pledge and end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, after the previous government pushed the deadline back to 2035. Uber's push to get customers to pick the green ride option is part of the company's overall sustainability aims - that all its car journeys and deliveries should be carried out in ""zero emissions vehicles"" by 2040. But the ambition is set to become more challenging as it plans to expand beyond cab rides and food delivery. Customers can already pick an EV when they book an Uber. A new option will allow them to register a permanent preference for taking an electric vehicle. Most Ubers are still petrol, diesel or hybrid vehicles, so it is likely customers will have to wait a little longer for an EV to arrive. ""We're not saying, hey, wait 15 minutes, but if you have to wait another two, three minutes to help the environment, why not make that investment?"" Mr Khosrowshahi said. In London, almost a third of Uber drivers have invested in an EV, so the difference in waiting times may not be long. But EV uptake is lower elsewhere in the UK and worldwide. In European cities such as Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Lisbon, Madrid and Paris only 20% of the miles driven by Uber vehicles are fully electric. As well as benefiting the planet, Mr Khosrowshahi believes the shift to electric will benefit Uber's business in the long run. However, he says the firm currently makes a smaller profit margin on electric car rides. Uber strikes EV deal with Chinese Tesla rival BYD EU hits China with big taxes in electric car sales battle Uber is also introducing more delivery services, hoping to challenge rivals on things like household products and groceries. ""You can get pet food from your local shop with an Uber courier within the next hour or two,"" said Mr Khosrowshahi. ""Ultimately we think that [it] can be even better than Amazon,"" he said. Critics have pointed out that ride-hailing and delivery services have already contributed to a rise in the number of car journeys being made, whether that's swapping a night bus for a cab ride, or getting a bubble tea delivered to your desk. Mr Khosrowshahi wants to take on rival Amazon in home deliveries Mr Khosrowshahi said he understood that governments had broader things to consider around tariffs on electric vehicles, but saw Chinese-made vehicles as part of the solution. ""For us we want to electrify our fleet and we want to make sure that it is affordable for our drivers,"" he said. Price is one of the biggest obstacles to the broader take-up of electric cars. Concerns over electric charging infrastructure have also contributed to EV sales stalling in many parts of the world. Mr Khosrowshahi said he thought governments should be providing more support for the switch to electric, including in the UK, but he would like that support to be targeted at those who drive the most, such as Uber drivers, or for corporate fleets, rather than individuals. ""The Uber driver drives four to five times the miles of average drivers,"" he said. Carmakers are calling for subsidies to be more balanced between business and individual buyers to encourage demand more broadly. The US and European Union (EU) argue the Chinese are unfairly subsiding their carmakers and have imposed tariffs - or import taxes - to bring prices of Chinese cars more into line with domestic manufacturers. The UK has not imposed tariffs on Chinese-made cars. Using tariffs to make Chinese cars more expensive for European and American consumers was ""negative"" for the planet, Mr Khosrowshahi said. Without such tariffs, cars made by Chinese firms could potentially be supplied more cheaply to consumers in US and EU. Uber also has a tie-up with Chinese carmaker BYD, the second-largest EV company after Elon Musk's Tesla. Do you pick the green ride option? Please share your experiences...."
BBC,0.05855610077732243,Blackpool taxi drivers angry with move to grant Uber licence,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx253dxl849o,,"Uber was formally granted a licence in Blackpool with no opportunity for debate Taxi drivers in a seaside town have hit back at a council decision to approve an operators’ licence for Uber behind closed doors. Uber was formally granted a licence in Blackpool in September although the app's drivers had already been plying for trade in the town while licensed by other local authorities. The decision was made by licensing officers using their delegated powers. However, the Blackpool Taxi Association said the number of complaints made against out-of-town Uber drivers who were already working in Blackpool meant the application should have gone before the public protection sub-committee for further debate. Blackpool Council said the licence had been granted to Uber as there was nothing to “call into question the fitness and propriety of the applicant”. The approval was revealed at a meeting of the full council, with the authority saying Uber had fulfilled all the necessary criteria. However, the Blackpool Taxi Association, said members had gathered evidence some Uber drivers had contravened rules. Secretary Bill Lewtas said: “In June 2023 we were asked to send in details and footage of wrongdoing by out-of-town taxi drivers. ""This message was repeated again in April 2024, at a meeting attended by numerous taxi drivers and companies. “The council gave little or no feedback on this and what action, if any, was taken. But it was evident from taxi driver social media pages the number of complaints was considerable. ""It is our view these complaints should have been considered as part of the decision-making. ""Whilst we understand that a taxi operator’s request for an operator’s license would not normally require a decision by the public protection sub-committee, this is different because of the complaints."" Mr Lewtas also questioned why no details of where Uber would be based in Blackpool were revealed, when taxi policy states licences would not be granted for an operating base outside the town. The council said the Uber application was treated in the same way as previous applications made by the 27 private hire operators currently licensed. Paula Burdess, cabinet member for neighbourhoods, said: “The issues raised by local taxi drivers about drivers licensed outside the area could not lawfully be considered in relation to this application.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber terms mean couple can't sue after 'life-changing' crash,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy9j8ldp0lo,,"Georgia and John McGinty were seriously injured in an Uber crash in 2022 A couple who were left with life-changing injuries after their Uber crashed have been told they cannot sue the company because of the terms they accepted when using the app. Georgia and John McGinty, from New Jersey, in the US, are bound by a clause saying they could not take the case to a jury in a court of law. State judges ruled they had clicked a ""confirm"" button on the app on more than one occasion when asked if they agreed with Uber's terms of use. The McGintys argue they had not understood they were forfeiting their right to sue the company. They told the BBC the most recent time the terms were agreed to was when their daughter, then 12, had accepted them prior to ordering a pizza on Uber Eats. ""How would I ever remotely think that my ability to protect my constitutional rights to a trial would be waived by me ordering food?"" said Mrs McGinty. Uber told BBC News: ""Our Terms of Use are clear that these types of claims should be resolved in arbitration. It’s important to highlight that the court concluded the plaintiff herself, not her daughter, agreed to Uber's Terms of Use on multiple occasions."" Arbitration means the dispute is settled through a third party rather than in court - in this case a lawyer appointed by Uber. Legal experts say it tends to result in smaller financial settlements. The case has parallels with Disney's attempt to avoid being sued over a death at Disney World - in its case over the terms of a Disney+ membership -before the company changed its mind. In March 2022, Georgia and John McGinty were riding in an Uber in New Jersey when it crashed, and they suffered extensive injuries. Mrs McGinty's injuries included spine fractures and traumatic injuries to her abdominal wall. ""I was in the critical care unit for a week,"" she told the BBC. ""I had a horrible post-operative infection and almost died during this time, I wasn't able to care for my child who was suffering from unrelated injury,"" she said. John fractured his sternum and sustained injuries to his hand. ""I shattered my wrist, broke my hand, and I have a steel rod with about nine pins in it. I don't have full function of my left hand,"" he said. ""I am in pain every day."" He added that they ""accumulated a tremendous amount of medical debt"" and still need further medical treatment in the future, including a possible third operation for Georgia. A photo of the Uber car in the scrapyard after the crash The couple attempted to sue Uber over the crash, citing the seventh amendment of the US Constitution, which grants people the right to a trial by jury. But the tech firm argued that the couple could not take the case in front of a jury because of a clause inUber's US Terms of Use.,external The Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division agreed. ""We hold that the arbitration provision contained in the agreement under review, which Georgia or her minor daughter, while using her cell phone agreed to, is valid and enforceable,"" its judgement says. The judgment found the child had clicked the button to say she was 18 despite not being. Referring to her daughter's use of Uber Eats, Mrs McGinty says she does not know how it can be right that she is considered to have ""authorised my child to waive our rights to go to a trial if we're injured in a car accident."" ""I don't know how anybody makes that leap,"" she said. Arbitration clauses are ""very common,"" especially when dealing with large corporations, said Ted Spaulding, a personal injury lawyer based in the state of Georgia. An arbitrator is ""most often a lawyer who does this for a living,"" he said, who can ""act like a judge and a jury"". They decide on an outcome after weighing up arguments from both sides, and their fee is often split between both parties. In the US, the enforceability of arbitration clauses differs state by state. Inits case,Disney used the arbitration clause in their terms to argue that a man whose wife died at Disney World could not sue them in a court of law. Jeffrey Piccolo filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Disney after his wife, Dr Kanokporn Tangsuan, died following an allergic reaction at a restaurant, run by a third party, at Disney World Florida in 2023. Disney said Mr Piccolo had waived his right to a jury trial when he signed up to a free trial of Disney+ in 2019. Disney later withdrew its claim to arbitration and opted to proceed with a jury trial after media coverage of the lawsuit. ""We believe this situation warrants a sensitive approach to expedite a resolution for the family who have experienced such a painful loss,"" Disney executive Josh D'Amaro told the BBC in a statement in August. Mr Spaulding says: ""The law understandably says, 'Look, you have the duty to know what you're signing',"" referring to the terms and conditions people often accept when using a product or a service. However, he says ""the scope should be within the transaction that you're agreeing to"". Georgia McGinty during her recovery Georgia and John McGinty say the Uber case has been ""absolutely devastating"" to their family. Georgia says their daughter, now 14, ""suffered a lot of trauma as a result"". She had a separate physical health issue which she was going through at the time, which her parents found difficult to help with while going through their own injuries. ""Years of her life with her parents... were taken away,"" she says. ""Luckily, she's a fighter, like her parents are,"" says John. ""We are inadvertently teaching her adversity and strength and family and prayer and resilience."" Uber told BBC News: ""The court concluded that on multiple occasions the plaintiff herself agreed to Uber's Terms of Use, including the arbitration agreement."" The company added: ""We are dedicated to road safety."" Disney drops bid to stop allergy death lawsuit over Disney+ terms..."

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber: Dutch watchdog fines app €290m for driver data transfer,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy76v561g48o,,"The ride-hailing app Uber has been hit with a €290m (£246m; $324m) fine for transferring the personal data of European drivers to US servers in violation of EU rules, the Dutch data protection regulator said on Monday. The Dutch Data Protection Authority (DPA) said the transfers were a ""serious violation"" of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as they failed to appropriately protect driver information. According to the watchdog, information including ID documents, taxi licences and location data was transferred to the company's headquarters in the US over a two-year period. Uber said it would appeal the fine, which it called ""unjustified"". ""Uber's cross-border data transfer process was compliant with GDPR during a 3-year period of immense uncertainty between the EU and US,” an Uber spokesperson said. ""This flawed decision and extraordinary fine are completely unjustified,"" the statement added. While data transfers to the US are allowed under EU law, there is significant uncertainty around when they can occur without the need for further authorisation. DPA chairman Aleid Wolfsen said the company failed to meet GDPR requirements to “ensure the level of protection to the data with regard to transfers to the US.” “That is very serious,” he added, noting that Uber also failed to appropriately safeguard the data. The DPA said Uber collected sensitive information of European drivers, including taxi licences, location data, photos, payment details, identity documents, ""and in some cases even criminal and medical data of drivers"". It said it started the investigation after more than 170 French drivers complained to a French human rights group, which then filed a complaint to France's data protection watchdog. Under GDPR rules, a business that processes data in several EU countries must deal with the data protection authority where its main office is located. Uber's European headquarters are in the Netherlands. ""In Europe, the GDPR protects the fundamental rights of people, by requiring businesses and governments to handle personal data with due care,"" Mr Wolfsen said. “Think of governments that can tap data on a large scale,” he said, explaining, “businesses are usually obliged to take additional measures if they store personal data of Europeans outside the European Union."" It is the DPA's third fine against Uber following fines of €600,000 (£508,000) in 2018 and €10m (£8.5m) last year. The EU has rolled out a series of rules for big tech firms and imposed huge fines for breaches in recent years.

The two companies say they will offer Uber drivers incentives to switch to electric cars, including discounts on maintenance, charging, financing and leasing. The multi-year agreement will be rolled out first in Europe and Latin America, before being made available in the Middle East, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The announcement comes as EV sales around the world have slowed and Chinese car makers face higher import charges in places like the US and the European Union. ""The companies aim to bring down the total cost of EV ownership for Uber drivers, accelerating the uptake of EVs on the Uber platform globally, and introducing millions of riders to greener rides,"" the two firms said in a statement. They also said they will work to integrate BYD's self-driving technologies into Uber's platform. Earlier this year, Uber said it was working with Tesla to promote EV adoption among its drivers in the US and planned to develop a purpose-built EV with South Korean car giant Kia. The US, the European Union and other major markets have recently announced tariff hikes on China-made EVs in moves aimed at protecting their car industries. The move has prompted BYD and other Chinese EV makers to expand their production facilities outside China. In July,BYD agreed a $1bn (£780m) deal to set up a manufacturing plant in Turkey. The new plant will be able to produce up to 150,000 vehicles a year, according to Turkish state news agency Anadolu.

Bristol-based Vertical Aerospace hopes to launch its first flights for ""premium airline passengers"" in 2027, but expects the service to become “very affordable” once production grows. Bosses say the technology will eventually enable ""quicker and cleaner journeys"" compared with road or rail transport. The company's chief commercial officer Michael Cervenka said: “The potential is for this aircraft to be about the same cost as hiring an Uber."" Tech bosses hopes to receive regulatory approval for its eVTOLs, which stands for electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, by the end of 2026, with commercial flights beginning in the following year. The company has started ground tests of its most advanced prototype, named VX4. Mr Cervenka said the journeys will be fewer than 100 miles and are likely to be in three categories: airport shuttles, between locations with “gaps in ground transportation” such as between Manchester and Leeds, and sightseeing trips. He added they gradually hope to roll out thousands of aircraft. “Where it starts to become affordable is, we’ve got a vehicle that can fly lots of times a day, can carry lots of passengers, needs very little maintenance, is very efficient to operate. “We’re selling the aircraft. Our customers will set the prices (for journeys),"" he said. The Conservative government published a Future of Flying plan in March, which included an ambition for piloted eVTOL flights to begin in the UK by 2026, and pilotless flights by 2030. Mr Cervenka said: “We have this amazing ability with electrification, to replace a very complex, expensive, mechanical system – that has lots of single point failures – with a series of electric motors and batteries. “That enables us to completely change how you design the aircraft.” Tell us which stories we should cover in Bristol Follow BBC Bristol onFacebook,external,X,externalandInstagram,external.

Mohamed Muhumuthu-Atham agreed to pick up two Reading Council licensing officers outside a takeaway in the town’s Oxford Road on 2 December 2022. But when he recognised one of them, he drove off with one of the back doors of his Volkswagen Sharan still open. The 52-year-old was ordered to pay fines and costs totalling £1,195 at a hearing at Reading Magistrates’ Court on 17 June. Under law, private-hire taxis, like those driven by Uber drivers, can only be pre-booked and must not ply for hire, which means they must not be hailed in the street by members of the public and they are not allowed to use designated taxi ranks. Uber does not have a licence to operate in Reading and Muhumuthu-Atham is licensed by Fareham Borough Council. Muhumuthu-Atham, of Kingsgate Street, Reading, was also given eight points on his driving licence. He was previously found guilty of illegally plying for hire in November 2020.

He said he would inform the DfT that the current licensing regime makes it difficult to address breaches, and ask for the law to be looked at again. A council spokesperson said it was ""actively investigating"" a complaint. ""More recently we have been provided with additional evidence, which means that our investigation has been extended,"" they added. The council did not confirm what the apparent licensing breach is.

City of York Council's licensing committee voted last week to approve a new application by the online ride-hailing firm to operate there. But campaigner Flick Williams said Uber had been ""quite clear that if they were granted a licence there would be no option to book a wheelchair accessible taxi"". In a statement, a spokesperson for the company said:  ""Ensuring the Uber platform is accessible for all riders is a key priority for us."" When Uber's licence was refused in 2017, City of York Council gave two main reasons. The first was that there was a significant data breach in 2016 which affected 57 million users, and the company had failed to report this to the authorities. There had also been a rise in complaints about Uber drivers in York, which the council said indicated that there were ""management issues"". Despite not having a licence in York since the ban, Uber drivers from other areas have been allowed to operate legally in the city using licences granted elsewhere. Ride-hailing firm Uber was banned from operating in York for six years from 2017 Ms Williams said granting a new licence to Uber ""leads directly to a reduction in the number of wheelchair accessible taxis available"". ""The council should have refused it. Uber had their licence removed in 2017 and have continued to operate, so granting them a licence now is, in effect, rewarding bad behaviour,"" she added. The campaigner described the new licence as ""a deeply bad decision for all disabled and older people in the city"". ""That's particularly because Uber were quite clear that if they were granted a licence there would be no option to book a wheelchair accessible taxi,"" she said. Members of York City Taxi Association held a protest against the application outside the council’s offices ahead of the four-hour meeting last Tuesday. Arshad Mahmood, the association's chairman, said they were ""disappointed"" at Uber being given a new licence to run vehicles in the city. “This decision has definitely overlooked the 44 wheelchair Hackney taxis and wheelchair taxi users. We are already low in numbers of the wheelchair taxis,"" he said. Arshad Mahmood, from York City Taxi Association, says the decision to grant the licence ignores the needs of wheelchair users Responding, Uber said: ""We have a specific in-app option called Uber Access which is available in a number of cities across the country. Drivers providing these services are specially trained. ""Our ability to make the Uber Access option available in the app is dependent on the volume of private hire wheelchair accessible vehicles in a given town or city and the number who choose to drive with Uber. ""Should we see sufficient volume of private hire wheelchair accessible vehicles sign up to Uber in the city, we would look to make this additional option available for riders in York."" James Gilchrist, director of transport, environment and planning at City of York Council, said: “City of York Council’s licensing committee met and determined to grant a private hire operator’s licence to the applicant.

The claimants allege that in order to obtain a licence to operate in the city, the ride-hailing giant deliberately misled Transport for London (TfL) about how its app worked. Litigation management firm RGL Management says the claim is worth at least £250m, with cabbies potentially getting £25,000 each. “These old claims are completely unfounded,"" an Uber spokesperson told the BBC. ""Uber operates lawfully in London, is fully licensed by TfL, and is proud to serve millions of passengers and drivers across the capital,” they added. TfL did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. The group action focuses on Uber's operations in London between May 2012 and March 2018. The claimants also allege that Uber's intention was to ""unlawfully... take business from existing black cab drivers"", according to a statement by RGL. ""Uber seems to believe it is above the law and cabbies across London have suffered loss of earnings because of it,"" said Garry White, who has been a black cab driver for 36 years.  ""It is time they were held to account.” Law firm Mishcon de Reya has filed the group action in the High Court on behalf of the claimants. ""Uber has consistently failed to comply with the law that applies to private hire vehicles in London"" said Richard Leedham, partner and head of commercial disputes at Mishcon de Reya. Over the years, Uber has faced a number of challenges in London, as well other cities around the world. TfL refused to renew the company's licence in 2017, saying it showed ""a lack of corporate responsibility"" with ""public safety and security implications"". At the time, Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi apologised for past mistakes and said the firm would dispute the decision. Uber successfully appealed after renewal of the licence was again denied two years later. In 2022, a two-and-a-half-year licence to operate in London was granted. It is due to expire at the end of September. Uber has also been the focus of demonstrations organised by London's black cab drivers. Earlier this year, Uber agreed to pay A$271.8m ($177.7m; £141.7m) to settle a lawsuit in Australia, according to a law firm for taxi operators and drivers. Maurice Blackburn Lawyers filed the class action on behalf of more than 8,000 taxi and hire car owners and drivers. The case alleged they lost income when the ride-hailing giant ""aggressively"" moved into the country. ""Since 2018, Uber has made significant contributions into various state-level taxi compensation schemes, and with today's proposed settlement, we put these legacy issues firmly in our past,"" Uber said in a statement. The company did not disclose the size of the proposed settlement. In December 2023, Uber won a lawsuit brought against it by 2,500 taxi drivers in France.

According to the Clark County Sheriff's Office, driver Loletha Hall, 61, was shot multiple times by William Brock, 81, outside his South Charleston home last month. A scammer had contacted Mr Brock, demanded thousands of dollars and threatened to kill his nephew. He has pleaded not guilty to a charge of murder. Ms Hall, according to officials, was also sent to Mr Brock's house by a scammer and instructed to pick up a package. Police released dashcam footage of the 25 March incident showing Mr Brock brandishing a pistol and pointing it at Ms Hall to prevent her from leaving. During their investigation, officials discovered that an unknown man had called Mr Brock and told him he needed to pay $12,000 (£9,600) to get his nephew out of jail. Police say the caller threatened to kill his nephew if he did not pay the ransom. A scammer also hired Ms Hall through the Uber app and sent her to pick up a package from Mr Brock's home. She was unaware of the threats he had received, officials say. ""Ms Hall, suffering from medical conditions and unarmed, made no threats or assaults toward Mr Brock, and made no demands, other than to ask about the package she was sent to retrieve,"" the sheriff's office said in a statement. Mr Brock then allegedly pointed a gun at Ms Hall and demanded she reveal the identity of the caller. She tried to leave, saying she would call police. In the dashcam footage, Mr Brock is heard demanding that Ms Hall give him her phone. He also refused to allow her to leave, police said. When she returned to her car, there was a ""scuffle at the door of Ms Hall's vehicle"", police say, which ended in Mr Brock allegedly shooting her multiple times. He then called 911, according to a police report, and was found bleeding with an injury to his head and ear when law enforcement arrived. Ms Hall was then taken to hospital, where she died from her injuries. The sheriff's office is still searching for the scam callers.

When Pa Edrissa Manjang began working for Uber Eats, in November 2019, its app did not regularly ask him to send selfies in order to register for jobs. But the Microsoft-powered Uber Eats app increased these verification checks. And in 2021, it said after ""careful consideration"" his account would be removed, due to ""continued mismatches"". An Uber representative said: ""Our real-time ID check is designed to help keep everyone who uses our app safe and includes robust human review to make sure that we're not making decisions about someone's livelihood in a vacuum, without oversight."" The Equality and Human Rights Commission and the App Drivers and Couriers Union funded Mr Manjang's case. The EHRC was concerned the artificial intelligence in the facial-recognition checks had deprived him of his income. The ADCU said the number of selfies Mr Manjang had been asked for amounted to racial harassment. The union told BBC News it was ""working hard"" to ensure workers' rights were protected as ""the pace of development of AI and machine-learning tools in the workplace accelerates"". Mr Manjang, who was reinstated and continues to work for Uber Eats, in Oxfordshire, said the out-of-court settlement marked the end of a ""long and difficult"" period for him.

Maurice Blackburn Lawyers filed the class action on behalf of over 8,000 taxi and hire car owners and drivers. The case alleged they lost income when the ride-hailing giant ""aggressively"" moved into the country. ""Uber fought tooth and nail at every point along the way,"" the law firm said. ""Since 2018, Uber has made significant contributions into various state-level taxi compensation schemes, and with today's proposed settlement, we put these legacy issues firmly in our past,""Uber said in a statement,external. The company did not disclose the size of the proposed settlement. ""It would be inappropriate to comment on specifics until the agreement is finalised and the settlement is disclosed to the court,"" it said. The class action was filed against Uber in 2019 in the Supreme Court of Australia's Victoria state. ""This case succeeded where so many others have failed. In Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia, cases were brought against governments and all of them failed,"" Maurice Blackburn principal lawyer Michael Donelly said. ""What our group members asked for was not another set of excuses - but an outcome - and today we have delivered it for them,"" he added. Before any pay out can be made the court still needs to approve the proposed settlement as being in the best interests of group members. San Francisco-based Uber, which was founded in 2009, operates in around 70 countries and more than 10,000 cities globally. Over the years, it has faced protests by taxi drivers in cities around the world. In December 2023, the company won a lawsuit brought against it by 2,500 taxi drivers in France.

Neil O'Brien, MP for Harborough, is concerned of safety issues if drivers are ""doing illicit cash-in-hand work"". Harborough District Council said it would undertake weekend surveillance and discuss the issues with local taxi drivers at their next forum meeting. Uber says it is ""committed to safety and raising standards"". Taxi drivers in Market Harborough are licensed and regulated by the district council and have paid to operate in the area. It is illegal for Uber drivers, who are licenced in other council areas, to use taxi ranks and pick up fares in the town. Mr O'Brien claims Uber drivers from outside the district are picking up passengers from taxi ranks illegally, which was taking trade and earnings away from local drivers, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). He said taxi drivers had told him they had to pay up to £1,000, which includes to be regulated by the district council and to use official taxi ranks. ""Taxi drivers here go through much more rigorous testing to get their taxi licences than in other areas,"" he said. ""The fear is that if people from all around the country are coming and doing illegal cash-in-hand taxi work, they may also have poor standards more generally and treat passengers badly. ""The whole point of licencing is that it should be simple to contact the council and get redress if there is a problem."" Mr O'Brien added Harborough taxi drivers told him they wanted the district council to take ""proper enforcement action"". Darren Woodiwiss, the council's cabinet lead for environmental and climate change, said: ""We understand the frustrations of our local taxi drivers and the safety concerns they have raised and will look to undertake some weekend evening surveillance. ""We will also discuss the issues with them at the next scheduled taxi forum meeting."" An Uber spokesperson said: ""Uber is committed to safety and raising standards across the industry.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Deliveroo and Uber Eats riders strike on Valentine's Day,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68274158,,"Takeaway delivery drivers are striking on Valentine's Day to demand better pay and improved working conditions. The action, impacting four food apps including Deliveroo and Uber Eats, is thought to involve as many as 3,000 drivers and riders on Wednesday between 17:00 and 22:00 GMT. One cyclist taking part told the BBC their pay was ""absolutely ridiculous"". Deliveroo said rider retention rate was ""high"" and it reviewed pay yearly. Just Eat said its rates were ""competitive"". The action, organised by a grassroots group of couriers is intended to draw attention to what has been described as poor pay and working conditions many riders face while delivering food and groceries in cities across the UK. Aside from Deliveroo and Uber Eats, Just Eat and Stuart.com will also be affected, with couriers who normally compete across multiple apps for delivery planning to refuse to take orders. ""Sacrificing a few hours for our rights is essential, instead of continuing to work incessantly for insufficient wages,"" the group Delivery Job UK said onits Instagram page.,external ""Our request is simple: we want fair compensation for the work we do. We are tired of being exploited and risking our lives every day... It's time for our voices to be heard."" Diorge, 25, who delivers around south West London, works for two of the involved apps and said he stopped taking orders at 17:00 on Wednesday. He is part of a group of couriers organising the action. Diorge said he wants to be seen as a human and not a ""delivery machine"" ""All we are asking is to be seen as humans and not machines. We are not delivery machines,"" Diorge said in a statement. ""To make the minimum national wage we have to make at least four deliveries, which is not as easy as it seems."" The action will extend beyond the UK. In the US, drivers for Uber, Lyft and food delivery firms are also set to halt work for two hours on Wednesday, according to Justice for App Workers, which says it represents more than 130,000 app drivers. Organisers said members would not be giving any rides to and from the airport in 10 major cities, including Chicago and Miami. Delivery Job UK claimed its delivery riders were braving the ""cold, rain and absurd distances"" for deliveries paying ""ridiculous values"", ranging from £2.80 to £3.15. A spokesman for the group told the BBC striking Deliveroo riders wanted an increase to a minimum of £5. The other companies use different pricing structures. ""They [Deliveroo] have lowered their fees. There's no incentive anymore. On a Friday night you could make £100 over 4-5 hours, now that's gone,"" the spokesman said. He also claimed couriers were exposed to ""a lot of violence on the streets"", especially in the evenings. Deliveroo not forced by law to engage with unions Children working for food delivery apps, BBC finds Joe, a courier in London since 2018 who plans to strike on Wednesday, said the work was ""incredibly isolating"" and attracted a lot of migrant workers who were unable to challenge the conditions and were ""forced into it"". ""Conditions are shocking,"" he told the BBC. ""The pricing of fees is aggressive. It's hard to overstate how sophisticated these algorithms have become. The fees are absolutely ridiculous."" Callum Cant, who has written about the gig economy and is a lecturer at Essex University, said changes to fees meant couriers had seen a 40% drop in wages in real terms since 2018. ""With a minimum fee of £2.80, most might only be making three orders an hour, and then they have to subtract their costs too. Some are making £7 an hour, which in London is barely liveable,"" he said. While delivery drivers are not formally unionised the GMB has an agreement with Deliveroo which, the union has said, is the first of its kind in the food delivery sector. It includes access to education courses and a pay floor for fees, negotiated each April. In a statement, Deliveroo said it offered its riders self-employed, flexible work, alongside protections. ""Rider retention rates are high and the overwhelming majority of riders tell us that they are satisfied working with us"", a spokesperson said. ""We are pleased to also be able to offer riders free insurance, sickness cover, financial support when riders become new parents and a range of training opportunities."" Uber Eats told the BBC it offered a ""flexible way"" for couriers to earn by using its app ""when and where they choose"". ""We know that the vast majority of couriers are satisfied with their experience on the app, and we regularly engage with couriers to look at how we can improve their experience."" Just Eat said it provided ""a highly competitive base rate to self-employed couriers and also offer regular incentives to help them maximise their earnings"". ""We continue to review our pay structure regularly and welcome any feedback from couriers,"" the company added.

The Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE) charity thanked the food delivery firm for agreeing to edit out parts that showed a man having an allergic reaction to peanut butter. Uber did not issue a statement butshared the edited version,externalof the ad. The Super Bowl is one of the most high profile marketing moments of the year. Tens of millions of Americans tune in for the American football championship, taking place later on Sunday, and the commercials that air during the game are expensive and typically planned months in advance. Uber started promoting its video online earlier this week. The one minute advert tells the tales of people forgetting key information, under the tagline ""Don't forget to remember Uber Eats"". The story of the man eating peanut butter, having forgotten it contains peanut, was originally featured alongside other moments of memory lapse involving big names, including actress Jennifer Aniston failing to recognise her Friends co-star David Schwimmer and David and Victoria Beckham trying to remember the name of her former band, the Spice Girls. ""Remember when you used to be a Pepper Lady?"" the former England captain says to his wife. FARE and other allergy groups had expressed concern about the advert, saying food allergies were not a joke and the juxtaposition was ""inappropriate"". On Friday Ms Poblete said she had spoken to the company, which had promised to edit out the reference to the peanut allergy. She thanked the company for listening. ""I want to thank you, our community, for speaking up so that our voices could be heard as we change the way life-threatening food allergies are perceived,"" she added. Special Group, the agency that helped Uber develop the ad, did not respond to a request for comment. Uber's swift response to the allergy advocates won praise online, though the embarrassment of the last minute fix seems like perhaps another episode that the company will want to forget.

The Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE) charity said it was ""surprised and disappointed"" to see the company use allergies as a joke. One person, himself allergic to peanuts, called the ad ""disgusting, tone-deaf and completely unnecessary"". The BBC has approached Uber Eats for a comment. ""Don't Forget Uber Eats"" was launched as the company's Super Bowl advert with millions of Americans expected to view it on Super Bowl Sunday. It features former Friends co-stars Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer, as well as David and Victoria Beckham. The premise of the advert is about people forgetting things. One scene shows the Beckhams in their kitchen, with David saying to former Spice Girl Victoria, ""Remember when you used to be a Pepper Lady?"" She responds, ""Wasn't it the Cinnamon Sisters?"" But the controversy comes when it features a man - appearing to have an allergic reaction with hives on his face and a swollen eye - asking, ""There's peanuts in peanut butter?"" as he looks at the label of the jar.

Dr Sung Poblete, head of the charity FARE, said she found adverts that use food allergies as humour concerning as it could encourage bullying among children. ""These types of commercials and types of jokes allow kids to think that there's not going to be any harm and it's going to be funny,"" she said. She said she wanted to educate Uber Eats on what it is like to live with a food allergy to help raise awareness. Anaphylaxis,externalis defined by the NHS as a life-threatening allergic reaction that happens very quickly. It can be caused by food, medicine or insect stings. The ad appears to try to cover its humour by stating in a small font at the bottom of the screen: ""Please please please do not forget there are peanuts in peanut butter."" But JD Arland in Indiana, who is allergic to peanuts and soy, said: ""The text at the bottom makes it even worse."" When JD Arland first saw the ad, he thought it was a joke He took to social media to vent his frustration, saying: ""Disgusting, tone-deaf, and completely unnecessary use of an allergic reaction in an ad. ""I have been ruthlessly bullied throughout my life by this stereotypical depiction of anaphylaxis. Perpetuating this offensive joke is unacceptable Uber Eats."" Despite his anger, Mr Arland, who is a content manager for a sports website, told the BBC he saw an opportunity for education. ""As somebody [with food allergies]... ordering delivery is really hard, because you have to not only know the restaurant, but how it's being prepared, and you have to rely on the the driver, or the app or the system to relay your special instructions to the restaurant. ""So I'd love to see more of a commitment from Uber Eats to the food allergy community on their platform.""

Rob Wright, 60, was at a wake in Kingswinford, Dudley, with his wife Kay when he booked an Uber ride to return home to Stourbridge. He said the 15-minute journey cost him £5.91, but the next day, the driver charged him an additional £80 for a cleaning fee. Uber has apologised, and Mr Wright - who denies any mess-making - has been issued with a full refund.

However, the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association (LTDA), which represents more than 10,000 members, said it was not consulted ahead of Uber's ""unilateral announcement"". The LTDA's Steve McNamara said joining Uber would be ""sullying"" the trade. But Uber said a ""small number"" of cab drivers had already signed up. A spokesman for the US-based business added it hoped to recruit ""several hundred"" by January. Mr McNamara, LTDA general secretary, said there was ""no demand for this partnership"" from the drivers it represented and that London's cabbies had seen ""significant growth since the pandemic, with record demand for cabs, more work through taxi apps and huge levels of investment being made in new electric taxis"". ""We don't believe our members will even consider joining the app, given its well-documented poor record on everything from passenger safety to workers' rights in London,"" he said. Uber has always said it operates ""lawfully"" in London. Uber granted licence to operate in London Uber spared from London ban despite 'past failings' The ride-hailing service said Hameed Hameedi, who completedthe Knowledgein 2015, was the first London cab driver to have signed up. ""Uber opening up to black cabs will be a huge advantage to the trade,"" said Mr Hameedi. ""App bookings are good for me because I know where my next job will be. More passengers booking trips means more cash for cabbies."" But London licensed taxi driver, Howard Taylor, said he would ""never consider joining Uber"". ""London black cabs are the gold standard,"" he said. Uber says it will be offering black-cab drivers who sign up six months free commission for bookings on the app. ""That's how they lure people in and that's how they did it when they started in London, by offering cheap fares to passengers, and once they'd got them on to the platform the fares got hiked again,"" Mr Taylor said. He added: ""We go the extra mile to help our passengers and are committed to providing a safe, accessible and efficient service. From everything I've seen, I don't believe Uber shares these commitments."" For years the black-cab community has hated Uber. It has orchestratedmany demonstrations and campaigns against the appwhich came to London to try and disrupt the market in 2012. Black hackney cabs are meant to be the only cars you can hail on the street, but the app technology and smartphones changed that and meant people started ""e-hailing"" minicabs. Many cabbies thought that was unjust. Uber has also not always had a good relationship with the London authorities. Itlost its licence in 2017after Transport for London accused the company of having ""a lack of corporate responsibility"" with ""public safety and security implications"". It highlighted shortcomings reporting criminal offences and doing background checks. Itkept its licence on appealand has since tried to clean up its act. The big question is will black cabbies join Uber in big numbers? This has been a long, bitter dispute and, as one said to me, cabbies have very long memories. Andrew Brem, general manager of Uber UK, said: ""Uber and taxis are better together. ""Black cabs are an iconic part of the capital, loved by Londoners and visitors alike, and we are proud to work side by side.

It resolves a long investigation by the New York attorney general, who called it the largest wage theft settlement in her office's history. The agreement also means that drivers in the state will receive guaranteed paid sick leave. Uber called it a ""landmark"", while Lyft said it was ""a win for drivers"". The settlement means that neither company has to admit fault, with Uber paying $290m as part of it, while Lyft will pay $38m. Both have denied any wrongdoing and praised the announcement. It comes as part of a long-running debate over whether the ride-sharing apps in the ""gig economy"" should class drivers as employees or as self-employed workers. ""For years, Uber and Lyft systematically cheated their drivers out of hundreds of millions of dollars in pay and benefits while they worked long hours in challenging conditions,"" New York attorney general Letitia James said in a statement. Her office looked into claims that that Uber and Lyft improperly deducted taxes and fees from New York drivers, rather than their passengers, between 2014 and 2017. It also alleged that the companies failed to provide drivers with paid sick leave, which employees are entitled to in New York law.

Uber said the agreement on Thursday would serve as a ""model for other states"", putting into place rules which mean New York City drivers receive up to 56 hours of paid sick leave per year. Uber drivers outside of New York will be entitled to an hour of sick leave at full pay for every 30 hours worked and a minimum wage of at least $26 per hour. The earnings standard which has been in place for several years will remain for drivers in New York City. Both firms described the announcement as a ""win for drivers"". Lyft drivers outside of New York City will also earn a minimum of $26 per hour for ""engaged time"", while all of its New York drivers will be eligible to accrue paid sick leave, it said in a statement. In 2021, the UK Supreme Court ruled Uber drivers must be treated as workers rather than as self-employed contractors, who have fewer entitlements. At the time, the ride-hailing giant called it ""turning the page"" on workers' rights and promised drivers would earn at least the National Living Wage.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,"Ola, Uber and Zomato: India's gig workers see hope in new state law",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66437170,,"Gig workers in India frequently protest against poor working conditions Gig workers in India are celebrating a small but significant victory in their ongoing fight for labour rights and better working conditions. The work is gruelling, hours are long, the pay is meagre and there's no job security or access to basic rights like paid leave, insurance or pension. But on 24 July, the western state of Rajasthan passed a landmark law that aims to provide platform-based gig workers social security benefits - a right they have been demanding for a long time - among other provisions. The Rajasthan Platform Based Gig Workers (Registration and Welfare) Act 2023 proposes to set up a social security fund by imposing a welfare tax of 1%-2% on every transaction made by a customer on apps that fall within its ambit, like food delivery and ride sharing. State government grants and contributions by gig workers will also be pooled into the fund. What is the 'gig' economy? The law also aims to create an online database of gig workers in the state by registering them and the platforms they're associated with; set up a system to address their grievances and a welfare board to monitor and enforce rules and fine aggregator platforms that don't comply. Many labour rights activists have praised the law saying it will give gig workers at least some of the rights enjoyed by those in the formal economy. They also say it will provide a model for other states to follow. But critics argue that the law might slow down the gig economy by irking customers, who may end up paying more for transactions as aggregator platforms could increase prices to pay the welfare tax. India has millions of gig workers, many of them youngsters Gig workers even in the US and UK,externalhave been unionising to demand labour rights. Their Indian counterparts have been doing the same as they aren't included under the country's labour laws, since they are not classified as ""employees"". Gig platforms also do not call themselves ""employers"", preferring the term ""aggregators"" instead and call their workers ""partners"" or ""independent contractors"". Experts say this is unfair as gig workers aren't given a share of the profits but are expected to adhere to rules laid down by the platform. India has a huge population of platform-based gig workers - alittle over seven million,external, according to the government-run think-tank Niti Aayog. But experts say that this number is likely to be higher. The country's soaring population has fuelled shortages in the job market, forcing many - especially youngsters - to turn to gig work to make a living. Jobs at risk as Delhi bans motorbike taxis Akriti Bhatia, a labour rights activist, calls the Act ""significant"" as it focusses on registering gig workers, which is the first step towards bringing them under a social security net. ""It also makes data transparent, including financial transactions of apps, and this can dissuade platforms from indulging in unfair practices - like deleting a rider's data or charging arbitrary fines,"" she adds. Nikhil Dey, member of a workers' rights group that spearheaded the drafting of the bill, says that the new law provides a system for workers to organise themselves by giving them representation in the form of a welfare board. It also offers a breakthrough in the way social security funds can be collected and disbursed. As per the law, every gig worker registered on the database will be given a unique ID, which will stay the same no matter the platform they work for and will be valid in perpetuity. Worker can use this ID to check their earnings across platforms through an integrated tracking and financial management system. So, for example, if a driver does two rides with Ola and four with Uber in a day, he can track his earnings across both platforms using the ID. ""This system also makes it easy for workers and the board to check who stands to gain how much in social security, depending on their earnings,"" explains Mr Dey. The nature of gig work isn't constant, and a worker might switch to another industry and never return; or return to gig work after a couple of months or years. In such a scenario, a person can choose to continue making contributions to the fund and enjoy the benefits after the fund matures, Mr Dey says. ""It was a strategic decision not to push for regulation but to find a way to implement something everyone agrees on - even aggregator platforms agree that gig workers should get social security,"" he adds. Experts also say that the Act circumvents some of the problems faced during previous efforts to grant workers social security. Gig workers in the US have been unionising to demand labour rights However, some experts have pointed out that the new law does not address more pressing labour rights issues, like a cap on maximum working hours or minimum earnings. They also say that there needs to be more clarity on how the welfare tax is going to be deducted, so that it is not cut from the workers' incentives or made up through fines. ""Only after the law is implemented will we be able to gauge its success,"" says Nilanjan Banik, an economics and finance professor at Mahindra University. Ms Bhatia, however, says that the law isn't challenging to implement if there is adequate political will. She also says that it provides a roadmap for the creation of similar laws across states and for different jobs in the unorganised sector. When India's top comedian became a food delivery rider Lawmakers and governments have become more amenable to the demands of gig workers - associations representing them say it's because they represent a sizeable vote bank. In 2020, thefederal government enacted the Code on Social Security,external, which obligates gig platforms to contribute towards a fund for their workers, but the rules for it are yet to be framed. In July, the Karnataka governmentannounced that it would provide,externalfree accidental and life insurance cover of 400,000 rupees ($4,827; £3,790) to gig workers and that the state would pay the annual premium. The new law too was passed by the Congress-led Rajasthan government just months before the assembly elections are due to take place in the state. Shaik Salauddin, a labour union leader who was a part of government discussions on the bill, says gig workers will continue to put pressure on governments to get their rights. ""Parties across the spectrum have realised our potential as a vote bank and they can't ignore us anymore,"" he says.

The ride-hailing company, famous for upending the global taxi business, wants to do the same for holiday travel, by expanding the services available on its app. Boss Dara Khosrowshahi discussed his ambitions to make Uber a go-to travel platform as the firm reported its first-ever global operating profit. The milestone came as a record number of Uber trips were taken this spring. Uber said about 25 million trips were made on the platform per day on average in the April to June period, up 22% year-on-year as travel in North America finally recovered from the pandemic. That amounted to nearly 2.3 billion total rides during the quarter. Mr Khosrowshahi said recovery in the travel business had opened an opportunity for Uber to become a bigger player  - especially in the UK, where travel agencies still play an outsize role compared with other markets such as the US. Flight bookings via the Uber app became available in the UK in May. It enabled train and coach bookings in the UK last year. ""Travel is a very important eco-system for us, both in terms of pick-ups and drop-offs, so we said hey, why can't we go after this tour operator market?"" Mr Khosrowshahi said. ""Essentially we are building up services that we think rival traditional tour operators."" So far, the new offerings have shown few signs of hurting demand for its core taxi service, as had been feared, he added. Mr Khosrowshahi, formerly boss of the online booking firm Expedia, was brought in as chief executive in 2017 to steady the company as it was grappling with the fallout from privacy and sexual harassment scandals and the ouster of founder Travis Kalanick. Mr Khosrowshahi has been pushing the company to improve its bottom line, emphasising cost discipline, with layoffs and other measures, efforts that he said were paying off. The underlying ride-hailing, food delivery and freight business posted a profit of $326m in the April-June period, compared with a loss of $713m in the prior year. ""For most of our history, 'profitable' wasn't the first thing that came up when you asked someone about Uber,"" he said. ""But we knew they were wrong."" Revenue grew 14% year-on-year to $9.2bn, while costs climbed only about 2%. Revenue growth was strongest outside US and Canada, which were hit by a decline in the company's small freight unit. But the firm's taxi business, which suffered when travel plunged during the pandemic and later struggled due to limited drivers, is growing healthily again, while food deliveries have remained robust.

Joseph Sullivan was found guilty of paying hackers $100,000 (£79,000) after they gained access to 57 million records of Uber customers, including names and phone numbers. He must also pay a fine of $50,000, and serve 200 hours of community service. Prosecutors originally asked for a 15-month prison sentence. Sullivan was also found guilty of obstructing an investigation from the Federal Trade Commission. According to the Wall Street Journal,,externaljudge William Orrick said he was showing Sullivan leniency partly because this was the first case of its kind, but also because of his character. ""If there are more, people should expect to spend time in custody, regardless of anything, and I hope everybody here recognises that,"" he said. Sullivan began his role as Uber's chief security officer in 2015. In November 2016,the attackers who targeted Uber emailed Sullivanand told him they had stolen a large amount of data, which they would delete in return for a ransom, according to the US Department of Justice (DOJ). Staff working for Sullivan confirmed data, including records of 57 million Uber users and 600,000 driving licence numbers, had been stolen. According to the DOJ, Sullivan arranged for the hackers to be paid $100,000 in exchange for them signing non-disclosure agreements to not reveal the hack to anyone.

The California appeals court found that,externala labour measure, known as Proposition 22, was largely constitutional. Labour groups and some workers had opposed the measure, saying it robbed them of rights like sick leave. The firms say the proposition protects other benefits such as flexibility. The latest ruling overturns a decision made by a lower court in California in 2021, which found that Proposition 22 affected lawmakers' powers to set standards at the workplace. The state of California and a group representing Uber, Lyft and other firms appealed against the decision. On Monday, a three-judge panel at the appeals court ruled that workers could be treated as independent contractors. However it removed a clause, which put restrictions on collective bargaining by workers, from Proposition 22. Shares in Uber and Lyft were almost 5% higher in after-hours trading. ""Today's ruling is a victory for app-based workers and millions of Californians who voted for Prop 22,"" Tony West, chief legal officer at Uber said. ""We're pleased that the court respected the will of the people and that Prop 22 will remain in place, preserving independence for drivers,"" Mr West added. Lyft said that the proposition ""protects the independence drivers value and gives them new, historic benefits."" The Service Employees International Union, which challenged the constitutionality of Proposition 22 with several drivers, said it was considering appealing against the court's decision. Biden 'gig' workers plan spooks Uber investors What is the 'gig' economy? In November 2020, voters in California passed Proposition 22 that allowed freelance workers to be classified as independent contractors. It was a victory for Uber and Lyft which run a $205m (£168.7m) campaign to support the measure. However, the win came with some concessions andcompanies were required to offer workers some benefits, including healthcare and accident insurance. Some drivers had backed Proposition 22 but other drivers and labour groups opposed it, pointing out all the benefits of being classified as employees including sick days, leave and overtime pay. Tens of millions of people work in the global gig economy across services like food delivery and transport. Gig workers are paid for individual tasks, such as a food delivery or a car journey, rather than getting a regular wage.

A government notice says that using private two-wheelers to carry passengers for hire violates Indian law.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Cost of living: Deliveroo and Uber couriers face uphill struggle,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-63914936,,"Atlanta Martin switched to an e-bike to save money on petrol and car insurance at work Lots of us have been cutting down on treats as the cost of living has continued to rise. It's meant luxuries like takeaways have become a rarity for many, and you might be more likely to catch the bus than take a taxi. And this is having a knock-on effect on the people who'd usually deliver that pizza or drop us off after a night out. Deliveroo rider Atlanta Martin says she's noticed people ordering less and has had to adapt to limit her costs. ""I delivered in a car for three years and now I've swapped to an e-bike,"" the 22-year-old says. ""Our pay hasn't gone up, sadly. ""So being on a bike, obviously I'm not spending on fuel, insurance, all of that."" Atlanta started riding in Worthing, near Brighton, during lockdown, sharing her trips on TikTok and YouTube, where she's grown her following to more than 50,000. ""Lockdown was great because it was so busy and the pay was slightly higher then, but it's dropped since,"" she says. The TUC estimates more than 4 million people in the UK work in the gig economy The Trades Union Congress (TUC) estimates that about 4.4 million people in the UK are platform gig economy workers - people who find jobs on apps like Deliveroo and Uber. One of the main advantages these companies advertise is that working for them is like being your own boss. You get to choose which jobs you do and when. It can provide flexibility and you're in control of how much you earn based on how many deliveries or pick-ups you do. At least, that's the theory. But there is a downside too - workers aren't paid expenses such as fuel, or for the time they spend waiting outside restaurants to pick up your meals. Often, that can mean what drivers and riders earn falls below the UK National Living Wage, which is currently set at £9.50 an hour. Atlanta lives with her partner which she said has cushioned the impact of rising prices. Although her hourly rate can sometimes be as little as £3, she says it often balances out during busier times. During the World Cup, for example, an increase in demand meant she could earn up to £35 an hour. ""You can make the money, I think you've just got to put in the hours,"" says Atlanta. ""And being on a bike now, obviously not having the extra expenses, has really made a difference."" Shaf Hussain says couriers have to take more risks to earn the same pay they got last year Shaf Hussain has been working for Deliveroo and Uber Eats since he was 21, delivering takeaways and shopping. ""Most people, they have fun in their 20s, being like: 'Let's go out partying, let's go enjoy life,"" says the 28-year-old Londoner. ""I was working as a courier most of my 20s, and now I haven't had a holiday in seven years."" Since the cost-of-living crisis hit, ""we're working a lot more for a lot less,"" he says. Like Atlanta, he's noticed fewer orders being made, meaning less work is available to him. Depending on how busy it is, Shaf says he can make anywhere between £6 to £15 an hour, ""but there's always a cost for that"". He lives with his parents to save money but hopes to one day soon have a place of his own. The truth about food courier pay Gig workers on Uber's decision to pay minimum wage Freelancers in 'constant fear' of bad reviews He says he puts pressure on himself to work a lot more - often meaning he has to weigh up his safety and wellbeing against his need for income. After several accidents over the years, Shaf has avoided working in poor weather. But, due to rising prices, he's now having to reconsider. ""Working in the snow, working in bad weather conditions is a risk,"" he says. ""And for us to take a day off, that means the next day we have to then go even harder than what we would normally. ""To take one day off we need to work two days essentially."" Unions want to see greater support for gig economy workers The TUC and other unions want to see greater protections for workers like Shaf and Atlanta who they say miss out on basic working rights. These include things like holiday pay, sick pay and pensions. One of those joining the calls is the IWGB, which describes itself as the union for people in insecure jobs. It found three quarters of platform gig economy workers were having to increase their working hours due to the cost-of-living crisis. Its research, based on a small survey of 266 gig workers, suggests that about half of respondents had seen a reduction in their monthly pay. Among those who responded, some said they were earning hundreds of pounds less each month. The TUC says it is difficult to obtain data about gig economy workers because they're described as self-employed, making understanding the problems facing the workforce a challenge. Deliveroo says there has beena small decline in the number of orders on the app,externaltowards the end of 2022. Shaf and Atlanta both say on their current pay they'd struggle to afford to live on their own, but neither plan to leave the industry any time soon. Last year, some couriersheld a demonstration calling for better pay and safetyand Deliveroo responded to say the vast majority were happy with the firm. A spokesperson told BBC Newsbeat it was proud to offer flexible work to 90,000 riders in the UK and that it had recently signed an agreement with the GMB Union to guarantee riders the national living wage.

About 300 taxi drivers held a demonstration outside Uber's offices in Bristol on Wednesday. Bristol United Private Hire Drivers (BUPHD) said they are unhappy with pricing structures and that they have to work longer hours to break even. Uber said drivers are always shown an upfront price before accepting a trip. The private hire drivers are now calling for booking apps to increase their fares so they can earn more money, adding that they can not cover their costs due to the current rates and charges imposed on them. BUPHD's Shaban Ali said private hire drivers in Bristol are finding it ""difficult to make ends meet"" BUPHD's Shaban Ali said the cost of living, fuel prices, as well as maintenance and licensing fees, were making it ""difficult to make ends meet"". ""We're looking at commission upwards of 50%, so for example every £10 that a passenger might spend with Uber, they're potentially getting £5. ""It's impacting our private lives because we're having to be on the road a lot longer,"" he added. Uber said that it does not take 50% per trip and said the average is closer to 25%, although it said it does vary. Drivers have called for Bristol City Council to step in but the council said although it is their responsibility to licence taxis, they are not responsible for regulating fares charged by apps. Mr Ali said drivers had no choice but to work with the apps but wanted them to sign up to an ""ethical and proper"" code of conduct. ""We have to work alongside them, we can't just boycott them and go direct to the customer, that's not how were regulated,"" he said. ""But if Uber decided to act in a more ethical manner, they're a market leader in Bristol and whatever they do all the other operators would follow.""

For a long time, Uber argued its drivers were self-employed - but since March 2021, it has had to offer employee benefits, including minimum wage, sick pay and a pension.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,"General practice is like calling an Uber, MPs say",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-63319694,,"Patients in England are being put at risk because of the unacceptably poor service they receive from GPs, MPs say. The House of Commons' Health Committee blamed the failure to tackle doctor shortages, which had led to a decline in the GP-patient relationship. Seeing a GP should not be like booking an Uber with a driver you are unlikely to see again, the MPs said. The warning comes just weeks after ministers launched a drive to improve access to GP services. Last month, Health Secretary Thérèse Coffeypromised same-day appointments for those that need them, alongside a guarantee no-one would wait longer than two weeks. Rules were relaxed so extra funding could be used to recruit non-GP staff, such as senior nurses - as well as asking pharmacists to take on more work to free up appointments - as the government is struggling to achieve its goal of recruiting an extra 6,000 GPs in this Parliament. But the cross-party group of MPs said more needed to be done. And continuity of care - seeing the same GP - was essential to spotting the signs of illnesses early and keeping people healthy and out of hospital. Committee member Rachael Maskell said: ""The important relationship between a GP and their patients is in decline. ""Seeing your GP should not be as random as booking an Uber with a driver you're unlikely to see again. ""General practice is in crisis with doctors demoralised and overworked."" Surveys show a sharp decline in the experience of people trying to see a GP. One of those who is unhappy is Alex Boys. He took his grandmother to an urgent care centre last month after being told it would take three weeks to see her GP. ""My gran had a very simple medical complaint to do with her toes,"" Alex says. ""It seemed like a minor issue - but because my gran is 93, with any medical complaint the anxiety she feels is very real for her."" Meanwhile, Amina Harun, who lives in London with her husband and two children, says her experience of using a GP practice has been ""appalling"". Her practice has had to rely on locums, she says, and the service is ""impersonal"". ""I've had terrible experience with my GP and still continue to have bad experiences,"" Amina says. ""You can't call to book appointments and have to do everything via an online app. ""This is not good for anyone that is vulnerable and unable to book via phone. ""The phone lines are always busy or there's usually a long wait."" The committee called for a return of personal lists, so each patient is assigned an individual GP, alongside an expansion of GP training places. By 2027, 80% of GP practices should be using personal lists, it said, and 100% by 2030. The committee said the poorest areas, which tended to have the fewest doctors and highest levels of ill-health, needed more funding. An analysis by the Nuffield Trust think tank earlier this year for BBC News found atwo-fold variation in the number of patients per GPacross different areas of England. Prof Martin Marshall, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: ""The report recognises what the college has been saying for many years - that GPs and our teams are working under unsustainable workforce and workload pressures and this is impacting on the care we are able to deliver to patients. ""We need to see urgent action taken."" Louise Ansari, from the patient group Healthwatch England, agreed the problems needed addressing. ""The impacts of poor access can be huge, with people feeling abandoned and suffering in silence and not getting referred to hospitals for more specialised treatment."" A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said its plan last month would help increase capacity and free up appointments, which would lead to improved access for patients. ""The health secretary is focussed on delivering for patients,"" he added. Millions miss out on seven-day GP access..."

Underthe US Labor Department's proposal,external, workers would be more likely to be classified as employees instead of independent contractors. Shares in firms including Uber and Lyft fell by more than 10% on the news. Tens of millions of people work in the global gig economy across services like food delivery and transport. US Labor Secretary Marty Walsh said the rule would aim to stop companies from misclassifying workers as independent contractors. Mr Walsh said his department had seen many cases where ""employers misclassify their employees as independent contractors, particularly among our nation's most vulnerable workers."" ""Misclassification deprives workers of their federal labour protections, including their right to be paid their full, legally earned wages,"" he added. Public consultations for the proposal begin on Thursday and are scheduled to run for 45 days. Uber loses $5.9bn as Asia investment values fall What is the 'gig' economy? Uber shares closed 10.4% lower in New York on Tuesday, while Lyft lost 12% and DoorDash ended down by 6%. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said the plan was ""a clear blow to the gig economy and a near-term concern for the likes of Uber and Lyft."" ""With ride sharing and other gig economy players depending on the contractor business model, a classification to employees would essentially throw the business model upside down and cause some major structural changes,"" Mr Ives said in a note. Uber, Lyft and DoorDash did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment. Gig economy firms have come under increased scrutiny as the industry grows in size. Payments firm Mastercard has estimated that 78 million people will be employed in the gig economy by next year. Gig workers are paid for individual tasks, such as a food delivery or a car journey, rather than getting a regular wage. Most US federal and state labour laws, such as those requiring a minimum wage or overtime pay, do not apply to gig workers. Last year, the UK's Supreme Court ruled that Uber driversneeded to be treated as workers rather than self-employed. This came after two former drivers argued that they should be entitled to the minimum wage and holiday pay. James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam first took the company to an employment tribunal in 2016. Uber said the ruling centred on a small number of drivers and it had since made changes to its business.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Former Uber security chief convicted for concealing a felony,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-63157883,,"Uber's former chief security officer has been convicted of failing to tell US authorities about a 2016 hack of the company's databases. A jury in San Francisco found Joe Sullivan - fired from Uber in 2017 - guilty of obstruction of justice and concealing a felony. Increasingly, companies negotiate with ransomware hackers. But investigators said they must ""do the right thing"" when their systems are breached. The conviction is a dramatic reversal for Sullivan, who had at one point in his career prosecuted cyber-related crime for the San Francisco US attorney's office. After Sullivan's conviction his lawyer, David Angeli, said ""Mr Sullivan's sole focus, in this incident and throughout his distinguished career, has been ensuring the safety of people's personal data on the internet,"" theWashington Post reported.,external But prosecutors said the case was a warning to companies. ""We expect those companies to protect that data and to alert customers and appropriate authorities when such data is stolen by hackers,""US attorney Stephanie M Hinds said.,external Ms Hinds accused Sullivan of working to hide the data breach from US regulator the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), adding he ""took steps to prevent the hackers from being caught"". At the time, the FTC was already investigating Uber following a 2014 hack. When it was hacked again, the attackers emailed Sullivan and told him they had stolen a large amount of data, which they would delete in return for a ransom, according to the US Department of Justice (DOJ) . Staff working for Sullivan confirmed data, including about 57 million Uber users' records and 600,000 driving-licence numbers, had been stolen. According to the DOJ, Sullivan arranged for the hackers to be paid $100,000 (£89,000) in bitcoin in exchange for them signing non-disclosure agreements to not reveal the hack to anyone, The hackers were paid in December 2016, even though they had refused to provide their true names. The payment was disguised as a ""bug bounty"", a reward used to pay cyber-security researchers who disclose vulnerabilities so they can be fixed. The Washington Post reported that the process enabled Uber to gather clues about the two hackers. The firm eventually identified the pair - both of whom have since been convicted of criminal offences - in January 2017 and required them to sign new agreements in their own names. This conviction has sent shivers down the spines of many cyber-security executives. With organised ransomware gangs, government-backed hacking teams and anarchist kids targeting companies, being a chief information security officer is already a daunting job. Sullivan being personally convicted for a decision taken on behalf of his employer sets a scary precedent, some say. For observers, the crimes Sullivan committed in 2016 also read as odd by today's standards. Negotiating with hackers and paying them to keep quiet is literally done every day  now by corporations hit by ransomware gangs. The key difference here, the jury found, is that Sullivan tried to cover it up. Giving cyber-criminals what they want no longer carries the seriousness it once did, but companies, then and now, must always be transparent about how they respond to cyber-incidents that affect them and their customers. The DOJ said that Sullivan ""orchestrated these acts despite knowing that the hackers were hacking and extorting other companies as well as Uber, and that the hackers had obtained data from at least some of those other companies"". A new management team at Uber eventually reported the breach to the FTC in 2017 after carrying out their own investigation. In 2018, Uber paid US states $148m to settle claims that it had been to slow to reveal the hack. The verdict was a surprise to many working in computer security. At the time Sullivan had reportedly informed some senior figures at Uber about the threat. The court also heard that internal legal advice had suggested that there was no need to disclose the hack if the attackers were identified, and agreed to delete the data and not spread it further. Responding to the judgement, Dr Ilia Kolochenko, founder of ImmuniWeb, and a member of Europol Data Protection Experts Network, wrote, ""The Uber case is just another illustrative example of the unfolding global trend to hold cyber-security executives accountable for their companies' data breaches. ""Serious misconduct, such as deliberate concealment of a data breach despite the regulatory requirement to report the breach to mitigate harm, may even entail criminal sanctions."" Dr Kolochenko said cyber-security executives should urgently check that their employment contracts address issues such as coverage of legal fees in case of a civil lawsuit or prosecution in relation to their professional responsibilities. The contracts should also contain a guarantee that their employer will not sue them - as victimised companies may also do this in case of security incidents, she added. Sullivan has not yet been sentenced, and may appeal against the judgement. Uber investigating computer system hack Uber ex-security chief 'covered up hack attack'..."

The ride-hailing company said it was investigating after several internal communications and engineering systems had been compromised. The New York Times firstreported,externalthe breach after the hacker sent images of email, cloud storage and code repositories to the newspaper. Uber staff were told not use the workplace messaging app Slack, the report said, quoting two employees. Shortly before the Slack system was taken offline, Uber employees received a message that read: ""I announce I am a hacker and Uber has suffered a data breach."" It appeared that the hacker was later able to gain access to other internal systems, posting an explicit photo on an internal information page for employees. Uber said it was in touch with authorities about the breach. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There has been no indication that Uber's fleet of vehicles, its customers or payment data have been affected by the hack. Uber pays a subscription fee to HackerOne, a bug bounty platform based in California. Bug bounty programs are used by a lot of big businesses - essentially they pay ethical hackers to identify bugs. Sam Curry, one of the bug bounty hunters, communicated with the Uber hacker. ""It seems like they've compromised a lot of stuff,"" he said. Mr Curry said he spoke to several Uber employees, who said they were ""working to lock down everything internally"" to restrict the hacker's access. He said there was no indication that the hacker had done any damage or was interested in anything more than publicity. Chris Evans, chief hacking officer for HackerOne, told the BBC: ""We're in close contact with Uber's security team, have locked their data down, and will continue to assist with their investigation."" The BBC has seen messages from someone who claims that various Uber admin accounts are under their control. The New York Times reports the hacker is 18 years old, has been working on his cyber-security skills for several years and hacked the Uber systems because ""they had weak security"". In the Slack message that announced the breach, the person also said Uber drivers should receive higher pay. The saying goes in cyber-security that ""humans are the weakest link"", and once again this hack shows that it was an employee being fooled that let the criminals in. Although the saying is true, it's also extremely unkind. The fuller picture emerging here shows that this hacker was highly skilled and highly motivated. As we saw with recent breaches of Okta, Microsoft and Twitter, young hackers with plenty of time on their hands and a devil-may-care attitude can persuade even the most careful employees into making cyber-security mistakes. This form of hacking through social engineering is even older than computers themselves - just ask infamous former hacker Kevin Mitnick, who was sweet-talking his way around telephone networks back in the 70s. The difference today is that hackers are able to combine the gift of the gab with very sophisticated and easy-to-use software to make their job even easier.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber attracts record number of drivers as cost of living bites,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62396648,,"The number of people driving for Uber has hit an all time high, as concerns about the rising cost of living push people to find new ways to make money. Almost 5 million people are now picking up passengers or making food deliveries for the company, 31% more than last year, boss Dara Khosrowshahi said. Uber has been struggling with a driver shortage since the pandemic, leading to longer waiting times for customers. High petrol prices also make it harder to earn money on the platform. But Mr Khosrowshahi said interest in driving for the company was accelerating despite those costs. ""That's right: more people are earning on Uber today than before the pandemic,"" he said in prepared remarks for investors to discuss the firm's financial performance. ""Against the backdrop of elevated gas prices globally, this is a resounding endorsement of the value drivers continue to see in Uber."" Uber has  been criticised for the treatment of its drivers. In the UK, the Supreme Court ruled last year that the company must count them as workers. But in many countries, including key markets such as the US, Uber classifies drivers as self-employed contractors, meaning they are not entitled to benefits such as minimum wage or holiday pay. Uber has said drivers value the flexibility to choose their own schedules. But it has also responded to concerns, for example introducing a fuel surcharge that customers pay to help offset driver costs. It also recently unveiled other changes, including allowing drivers to see how much they will make before agreeing to take a ride, aimed at making their platform more appealing to drivers. ""Rather than relying solely on financial incentives, our goal has been to improve drivers' overall experience,"" Mr Khosrowshahi said. Higher demand, which had plunged when the pandemic hit in 2020, is also helping to attract drivers back. Uber said there were 1.87 billion trips on the platform in the April-June period - an average of roughly 21 million per day - up 24% from last year, and 12% more than were taken in 2019 before the pandemic hit. The rise in demand helped push gross bookings up 33% to $29.1bn (£24bn) Revenue more than doubled to $8.1bn, though some of that was due to a change to how the company accounts for its UK business. Despite the gains, the company lost $2.6bn. It said more than half of that was due to a decline in the value of its stakes in overseas companies such as Zomato, Grab and Aurora. Uber shares jumped more than 13% after the better than expected results. The numbers suggest a path for Uber to become profitable, despite inflationary pressures and lingering driver shortages in some cities, said Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""In a nutshell, despite rising ride share prices throughout the US/Europe clearly consumers are still moving to the Uber platform especially as travel, shifting to the office, and other post pandemic trends take hold globally with Uber poised to benefit into 2023,"" he said.

The firm also agreed to waive charges for disabled users in the future. More than 1,000 people had complained about the fees, which often kick in if it takes more than two minutes to get into the car. Uber said its policy was to refund wait fees for disabled riders. In resolving the lawsuit, the ride-hailing company denied wrongdoing. ""It has long been our policy to refund wait time fees for riders with a disability when they alerted us that they were charged,"" the company said, adding that it had made changes before the lawsuit to have disabled riders' wait time fees waived automatically when Uber is notified that they were charged. Uber Files: Greyballing, kill switches, lobbying - Uber's dark tricks revealed Leak reveals top politicians secretly helped Uber Uber started charging wait time fees in some cities in 2016, eventually expanding the practice, according to the lawsuit, which theUS Department of Justice filed in November. The average fee was less than 60 cents, the company said at the time. Under the terms of the deal, Uber agreed to pay more than $1.7m to about 1,000 riders who complained, as well as $500,000 more to some people identified by the Department of Justice. Officials said the settlement would also yield ""hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in compensation"" for the more than 65,000 people who have signed up for the waivers. ""People with disabilities should not be made to feel like second-class citizens or punished because of their disability, which is exactly what Uber's wait time fee policy did,"" Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement.

The filing includes allegations women passengers ""were kidnapped, sexually assaulted, sexually battered, raped, falsely imprisoned, stalked, harassed, or otherwise attacked by Uber drivers"". The case was filed at the San Francisco County Superior Court on Wednesday. ""Sexual assault is a horrific crime and we take every single report seriously,"" an Uber spokesperson told the BBC. ""There is nothing more important than safety, which is why Uber has built new safety features, established survivor-centric policies, and been more transparent about serious incidents. While we can't comment on pending litigation, we will continue to keep safety at the heart of our work,"" they added. The complaint -filed by law firm Slater Slater Schulman, which said it represents 550 women,external- alleged that the sexual assaults took place in ""multiple states"". It also said that at least another 150 potential cases are being ""actively investigated."" However, an Uber spokesperson told the BBC that the company has served just 12 cases against it to date. Uber lobbied top ministers at undeclared meetings Leak reveals top politicians secretly helped Uber The lawsuit alleges that as early as 2014 Uber became aware that its drivers were sexually assaulting and raping female passengers. But the filing claims that the company prioritised ""growth over customer safety"".Uber sued in US over sexual assault claims ""Uber's whole business model is predicated on giving people a safe ride home, but rider safety was never their concern - growth was, at the expense of their passengers' safety,"" Adam Slater, founding partner of Slater Slater Schulman, said. Last month, Uber released itssecond US Safety Report,external, which showed there were 998 sexual assault incidents, including 141 rape reports, in 2020. In the report, the company said it had received a total of 3,824 reports of the five most severe categories of sexual assault between 2019 and 2020. The firm's first safety report, which details incidents from 2017 to 2018, found 5,981 reports of sexual assault. Uber's most serious categories of sexual assault range from ""non-consensual kissing of a non-sexual body part"" to ""non-consensual sexual penetration,"" or rape. The nature of these allegations is incredibly serious. What makes the lawsuit even more damaging for Uber is it could be seen to provide yet more evidence of a toxic culture at the company. On Monday an former Uber executive came forward with multiple accusations of malpractice. Among the evidence he leaked, that Uber had a 'kill switch' - that could be turned on if law enforcement came knocking - that would prevent police from finding information. Mark MacGann said the leaked documents pointed to a theme - that Uber put growth first above all else. And this lawsuit claims something similar - that the company intentionally concealed that Uber drivers had sexually assaulted women. In other words, Uber was outwardly saying its rides were safe, when in reality the company knew it had a problem. The lawsuit also says that the company didn't conduct proper background checks on its drivers. Uber says that the company has changed in recent years and regrets its past behaviour. But with so much bad press, investors worry that people will begin to turn elsewhere for their next ride.

UBER FILES:Leak reveals Macron among leaders who helped Uber UBER FILES:Greyballing, kill switches, lobbying - Uber's dark tricks revealed In the UK, Uber's behind-the-scenes campaign went right to the top. The files record a series of meetings between the company, its lobbyists and senior members of the then-government that went undeclared. They include meetings with the current home secretary Priti Patel, Tory leadership contender Sajid Javid, and recently sacked cabinet minister Michael Gove. The revelations are likely to prompt renewed concerns thatregulatory proposals which would have impacted Uber adversely in London, were droppedas government ministers put pressure on Boris Johnson. According to the files, Uber executives later reported that former chancellor George Osborne considered himself ""responsible"" for the ""positive"" outcome. Sue Hawley, chief executive of the campaign group Spotlight on Corruption, said the meetings should have been declared. ""It certainly breaches the spirit of the rules,"" she says, although the rules were sufficiently ambiguous at the time that they may not have been in breach of the letter. ""This is a very, very controversial company. So I think in that context, it is even more extraordinary that these meetings went undeclared by so many ministers,"" she adds. Since its arrival in London in 2012, Uber has been bitterly opposed by black cab drivers who see their fares being undercut and their livelihoods threatened. In 2014 parts of London werebrought to a standstill by cab driversin protests against the US tech firm. Black cab drivers protest in London, May 26, 2015 Mr Johnson was reluctant to engage with Uber directly because the company was so controversial. Yet an internal Uber strategy document in 2014 identified London as ""critical"" to the firm's success and Mr Johnson as ""the ultimate target"" of Uber's influence campaign. ""The Mayor remains the central figure in London government… the need therefore is for a more positive image of Uber to be conveyed to Boris, by people that he trusts and respects."" The Uber Files reveal how that campaign worked. The documents show that in July 2014 Uber lobbyists visited 10 Downing Street to meet then-Prime Minister David Cameron's advisers. Lobbyists reported back to Uber getting ""useful intelligence on Mayor's office"". According to the files, Uber lobbyists were confident their work would bear fruit. An email says that Mr Cameron's ""senior staff are very with us"". The documents show they also met current leadership hopeful Sajid Javid, then Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, and Matt Hancock, then Business Minister, during their visit to No 10. A spokesperson for Mr Javid said the ""relevant departments hold no record of the meeting said to have taken place"". Speaking to the BBC on Monday, during his leadership bid, Mr Javid said any meetings with Uber ""would have been reported"". ""So if they have not been reported in the ministerial transparency declarations, then I didn't have them."" Mr Hancock's spokesperson says it was the policy of government to attract tech companies to the UK and all his efforts were ""above board and declared properly"". The following month, Uber's controversial chief executive Travis Kalanick was invited to a small dinner with George Osborne, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, in California, at the home of a senior Google executive. The invitation came from Rachel Whetstone, wife of Steve Hilton, who was strategy director at the time for Mr Cameron. She had worked with him before at the TV company Carlton and Conservative HQ. At the time of the dinner she was senior vice president of communications and public policy at Google, which also had a major investment in Uber. She moved to Uber the following year. A note from Uber's public policy chief Corey Owens to Mr Kalanick makes it clear that the company regarded this as an opportunity to advance its cause with the chancellor, and not just a social occasion. It reads: ""I think this is worth you doing. We were going to get you in front of Osborne when you're in London, but this is a more private affair, no hanger-on officials or staffers."" Mr Osborne didn't declare the meeting. ""This is someone who is very personally known to the prime minister, opening doors to other ministers,"" Ms Hawley told the BBC. ""And I think that's really, really concerning. And it feeds the perception that big business is setting the government agenda. That's really damaging to our democracy."" Lawyers for Ms Whetstone said the dinner had been arranged ""at the then-chancellor's request to discuss innovation with leaders in Silicon Valley,"" and that she has never taken ""improper advantage of personal relationships with UK politicians"". TheMinisterial Code,externalsets out what UK government ministers should and shouldn't do. Ministers shown to have broken it are normally expected to resign. The 2010 version, which was in force when these meetings occurred, said: ""Ministers meet many people and organisations and consider a wide range of views as part of the formulation of Government policy. Departments will publish, at least quarterly, details of Ministers' external meetings."" By 2015 London's transport authority, TfL, was considering a series of measures which would have significantly dented Uber's competitiveness and stifled its rapid growth, including a minimum five-minute wait between booking a ride and pick-up. At the time, Mr Johnson, who, as mayor had oversight of TfL, revealed how he'd been lobbied to go easy on Uber, writing that he had been deluged by ""rampant, frothing, free-market Conservatives"" opposed to tightening regulations on private-hire vehicles. The files show Uber had continued targeting top Tories, as well as Labour and Lib Dem MPs. That December, in a meeting that was declared, Sajid Javid met executives from Uber who reported that he was ""clearly a supporter"". The same day, Mr Javid met with Mr Johnson and two other cabinet ministers, where he discussed TfL's proposals, according to emails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and reported by the Daily Mail. Priti Patel, now home secretary, met with an Uber lobbyist in Paris in January 2016, when she was minister of state for employment. The meeting wasn't declared. The files show a follow up letter from the minister proposing a partnership with Uber. A spokesperson for Ms Patel said: ""For official meetings such as this, civil servants are present… and responsible for making the appropriate recordings."" Also in January 2016, Michael Gove, then Secretary of State for Justice met with Ms Whetstone, by then Uber's public policy chief. The meeting wasn't declared. A spokesman at Mr Gove's former department said ""no official meeting took place"" in January 2016. That same month TfL proposals which would have hit Uber hardest, were shelved. Uber hailed it as a ""victory for common sense"". When asked in the London Assembly if he had been subject to ""enormous lobbying by the government"" on Uber's behalf, the mayor said hedid ""not deny that"",external. The Uber Files show that shortly after the TfL proposals were shelved, Mr Osborne met Travis Kalanick at the World Economic Forum conference in Davos, Switzerland. This time the meeting was declared. ""George Osborne is a strong advocate,"" an Uber lobbyist noted in an email after that meeting. ""He liked to believe that he's responsible for the positive consultation outcome."" A spokesperson for George Osborne said ""all business meetings where policy affecting individual companies [sic] were properly declared"", adding that far from being secret, it was the government's publicly announced policy to meet tech businesses and persuade them to invest in Britain.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber Files: Massive leak reveals how top politicians secretly helped Uber,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62057321,,"The files show Emmanuel Macron was on first name terms with Uber's founder while ex-EU commissioner Neelie Kroes secretly lobbied for the firm Thousands of leaked files have exposed how Uber courted top politicians, and how far it went to avoid justice. They detail the extensive help Uber got from leaders such as Emmanuel Macron and ex-EU commissioner Neelie Kroes. They also show how the taxi firm's former boss personally ordered the use of a ""kill switch"" to prevent raiding police from accessing computers. Uber says its ""past behaviour wasn't in line with present values"" and it is a ""different company"" today. The Uber Files are a trove of more than 124,000 records, including 83,000 emails and 1,000 other files involving conversations, spanning 2013 to 2017. They were leaked tothe Guardian,external, and shared with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,externaland a number of media organisations including BBC Panorama. They reveal, for the first time, how a $90m-a-year lobbying and public relations effort recruited friendly politicians to help in its campaign to disrupt Europe's taxi industry. While French taxi drivers staged sometimes violent protests in the streets against Uber, Mr Macron - now president - was on first name terms with Uber's controversial boss Travis Kalanick, and told him he would reform laws in the firm's favour. Uber's ruthless business methods were widely known, but for the first time the files give a unique inside view of the lengths it went to in achieving its goals. UBER FILES:Tech firm lobbied top ministers at undeclared meetings UBER FILES:Greyballing, kill switches, lobbying - Uber's dark tricks revealed They show how ex-EU digital commissioner Neelie Kroes, one of Brussels' top officials, was in talks to join Uber before her term ended - and then secretly lobbied for the firm, in potential breach of EU ethics rules. At the time, Uber was not just one of the world's fastest-growing companies - it was one of the most controversial, dogged by court cases, allegations of sexual harassment, and data breach scandals. Eventually shareholders had enough, andTravis Kalanick was forced out in 2017. Uber says his replacement, Dara Khosrowshahi, was ""tasked with transforming every aspect of how Uber operates"" and has ""installed the rigorous controls and compliance necessary to operate as a public company"". Paris was the scene of Uber's first European launch, and it met stiff resistance from the taxi industry, culminating in violent protests in the streets. In August 2014, an ambitious former banker named Emmanuel Macron had just been appointed minister for the economy. He saw Uber as a source of growth and badly needed new jobs, and was keen to help. That October, he held a meeting with Mr Kalanick and other executives and lobbyists, which marked the start of a long - but little-publicised - stint as a champion of the controversial firm's interests within government. Uber lobbyist Mark MacGann described the meeting as ""spectacular. Like I've never seen,"" the files show. ""We will dance soon,"" he added. ""Emmanuel"" and ""Travis"" were soon on first name terms, and met at least four times, the files show - in Paris, and at the World Economic Forum conference in Davos, Switzerland. Only the Davos meeting has been previously reported. At one point Uber wrote to Mr Macron saying it was ""extremely grateful"". ""The openness and welcome we receive is unusual in government-industry relations."" French taxi drivers were particularly enraged by the 2014 launch of UberPop - a service that allowed unlicensed drivers to offer rides, at much lower prices. Courts and parliament banned it, but Uber kept the service running as it challenged the law. Mr Macron didn't think there was a future for UberPop, but he agreed to work with the company to rewrite France's laws governing its other services. ""Uber will provide an outline for a regulatory framework for ridesharing. We will connect our respective teams to start working on a feasible proposal that could become the formal framework in France,"" an email from Travis Kalanick to Mr Macron reads. On 25 June 2015, the protests became violent, and a week later Mr Macron texted Mr Kalanick with an apparent offer of help. Protests against UberPop turned violent. Paris, 25 June 2015 ""[I] will gather everybody next week to prepare the reform and correct the law."" The same day, Uber announced the suspension of UberPop in France. The extent of the now-president of France's relationship with the controversial global firm that was operating in violation of French law has not been revealed until now. A spokesperson for Mr Macron said in an email: ""His functions naturally led him to meet and interact with many companies engaged in the sharp shift which came out during those years in the service sector, which had to be facilitated by unlocking administrative and regulatory hurdles."" Uber said the ""suspension of UberPop was in no way followed by more favourable regulations,"" and a new law that came into force in 2018 resulted in France adopting ""stricter regulations"" that were ""in no way beneficial to Uber"". The files also reveal how Uber's relationship with one of Europe's top officials, European Commission vice-president Neelie Kroes, began significantly earlier and ran deeper than previously was known, putting her in an apparent breach of rules governing commissioners' conduct. They reveal she was in talks to join Uber's advisory board before she even left her last European post in November 2014. EU rules say commissioners have to respect a ""cooling-off"" period, then 18 months, during which new jobs require the approval of the commission. As a commissioner, Ms Kroes oversaw digital and competition policy, and was a high-profile scourge of big tech, playing a leading role in hitting Microsoft andIntel with massive fines,external. But of all the companies she could have worked for after leaving, Uber was a particularly controversial choice. In her home country, the Netherlands, the UberPop ridesharing service had also brought legal and political trouble. Uber drivers were arrested in October 2014, and that December a judge in the Hague banned UberPop, threatening fines up to 100,000 euros. In March 2015, Uber's Amsterdam office was raided by Dutch police. Emails say that Ms Kroes called ministers and other members of the government to persuade them to back down during the raid.During another raid a week later, Ms Kroes again contacted a Dutch minister the Uber Files show, and, in the words of an email, ""harassed"" the head of the Dutch civil service. An internal email advised staff not to discuss her informal relationship externally: ""Her reputation and our ability to negotiate solutions in the Netherlands and elsewhere would suffer from any casual banter inside or outside the office."" The files show that the company wanted Ms Kroes to pass messages on to the office of the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte. In October 2015, an email reads: ""We'll get backchannel going with Neelie and the PM's Chief of Staff, to extract maximum advantage through 'giving' them the notion of a 'victory'."" She wrote to the commission's Ad Hoc Ethical Committee requesting permission to join Uber's advisory board before the 18 months were up, and appealed to commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. That permission was denied, but documents show Ms Kroes continued to help the company informally until her appointment was announced, shortly after the cooling-off period had ended. This underlines that Ms Kroes was in a ""clear breach"" of the rules, says Alberto Alemanno, Jean Monnet professor of European Union law at HEC Paris. Dutch PM Mark Rutte, Uber's then CEO Travis Kalanick and Neelie Kroes on a visit to Silicon Valley in 2016 ""You're proving the fact that you're doing something you are not allowed to do,"" he told BBC Panorama. ""Because if she didn't necessarily ask for permission, you might still argue there was a grey area, there was a grey zone. But now it's no longer there."" Looking at all the disclosures about Ms Kroes' relationship with Uber, he said: ""It makes me feel that our system is probably not fit for purpose because this situation should have been prevented."" Ms Kroes denies that she had any ""formal or informal role at Uber"" before May 2016, when the cooling-off period expired. She said as an EU commissioner she interacted with numerous technology companies, ""always driven by what I believe would benefit the public interest"". During the cooling off period, the Dutch government appointed her special envoy for start-ups, which involved interactions with a ""wide array of business, government and non-governmental entities"" with the aim of promoting a ""business-friendly and welcoming ecosystem in the Netherlands"", she said. A spokesperson for the Dutch ministry of economic affairs says that ""Uber was not considered a start-up in 2015"". Uber says Ms Kroes left the advisory board in 2018, and says it has since introduced new guidelines ""strengthening oversight"" of ""lobbying and external engagements with policymakers"" in Europe. If the police came knocking, Uber had a second line of defence - the ""kill switch"", which made it impossible for visiting law enforcement to access the company's computers. This would restrict officers' access to sensitive company data, such as lists of drivers, which the company believed would harm its growth. The files confirm earlier news reports about the kill switch, and reveal that Mr Kalanick himself activated the system at least once. ""Please hit the kill switch ASAP. Access must be shut down in AMS [Amsterdam],"" an email from his account says. The kill switch was also used in Canada, Belgium, India, Romania and Hungary, and at least three times in France. Uber says it has had no ""'kill switch' designed to thwart regulatory inquiries anywhere in the world"" since the new chief executive took over in 2017. A spokesperson for Mr Kalanick said he never authorised any actions or programmes that would obstruct justice in any country, and any accusation he did is completely false. He said Uber ""used tools that protect intellectual property and the privacy of their customers"" and that ""these fail-safe protocols do not delete any data or information, and were approved by Uber's legal and regulatory departments"".

PickMeUp was launched by the Oxford Bus Company in June 2018 as part of a two-year pilot but finished in June 2020. Martin Dean, from Go-Ahead Group, which owns the company, said delays meant it ""just couldn't pick up enough people"". In 2020 Oxfordshire County Council said it was a ""great idea"" but there was ""no obvious way"" of making it more viable. Oxford Bus Company started the service in 2018 Mr Dean, Go-Ahead Group's UK regional bus managing director, told the transport select committee on Wednesday that the service was run at the company's own risk. ""The problem with it was it just wasn't profitable enough. One of the issues which was interesting was it comes back to congestion,"" he said. ""We just couldn't pick up enough people in an hour to earn enough revenue per hour to cover our costs."" He said it was at its ""most profitable"" during school holidays when it could make up to 14 or 15 pick-ups in an hour but in term times only seven or eight pick-ups were being made.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber powers emergency food deliveries in Ukraine,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-61717071,,"Uber has built a ""private-label"" version of its delivery platform to help the United Nations deliver food and water supplies to war-torn areas of Ukraine. The tech firm is working with the UN's World Food Programme (WFP). It's difficult for large delivery trucks to access some parts of Ukraine because of structural damage and the threat of attack. Uber's platform enables the WFP to co-ordinate a fleet of smaller vehicles. The WFP is hand-picking its own drivers and vehicles, but some are former Uber drivers who worked in Ukraine before the Russian invasion. Uber boss Dara Khosrowshahi said his firm had given the WFP ""their own private-label Uber"". It's a bespoke version of the Uber Direct delivery platform which is available commercially - big name customers include Apple and Tesco. Usually, businesses pay Uber a commission per delivery for the service, but the WFP is not being charged. It can use the software to co-ordinate distribution, and track deliveries and drivers within a 100km range of its warehouses. The scheme is being trialled in the central city of Dnipro. The hope is that it will be rolled out later across four other cities: Lviv, Vinnytsia, Kyiv and Chernivtsi. The WFP is aiming to provide monthly supplies to 3m people in Ukraine by the end of June There are a number of aid organisations working to provide emergency supplies to those in need, including the Red Cross, the International Rescue Committee and Save the Children. Uber's platform was up and running within a few weeks of its first contact with the World Food Programme. ""It's not like you can wait a month to get food to people - people have got to get food immediately,"" said WFP executive director David Beasley. ""You can't go a few weeks without food, and so using Uber's technology, their distribution systems, their dispatch systems… it really is a great success story."" Uber has had a turbulent few years. Its ride-sharing service was hit hard during the pandemic as people stayed at home, and the firm has been forced to reform its driver policies, giving them better workers' rights. The move into deliveries has, however, been a success - Mr Khosrowshahi says that when he first became CEO in 2017, Uber's delivery arm was in its infancy, but it is now poised to become the firm's biggest service. In 2021,96% of Uber's delivery orders were for restaurant food,external. It was also the first year in which the 13-year-old firm reported a profit. ""I ultimately think that delivery can be bigger in scope because it's not just about food. It's groceries - and also empowering any local merchant to try to out-Amazon Amazon,"" said Mr Khosrowshahi. ""If Amazon can deliver next day, your local merchant can deliver in the next hour or two hours… people want delivery of everything at home as quickly as possible, and we can ride that wave.""

The firm said almost all of the loss was a result of the fall in the value of investments in businesses including two Asian ride-hailing giants - China's Didi and South East Asia's Grab. Shares in Didi and Grab have plunged since listing in New York last year. Despite the loss, Uber's boss highlighted its progress in recovering from the impact of the pandemic. ""Our results demonstrate just how much progress we've made navigating out of the pandemic and how the power of our platform is differentiating our business performance,"" chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said. That came as the company said the number of trips taken had risen 18% for the three months to the end of March, compared to the same period last year. That helped its revenue rise by 136%. On a net basis, Uber's first-quarter loss soared to $5.9bn from $108m a year ago, driven by $5.6bn of drops in the value of stakes in other businesses, primarily Chinese ride-hailing company Didi. However, Uber has enough cash to hold on to those loss-making stakes and wait for a better time to sell them, chief financial officer Nelson Chai said. Its shares ended Wednesday's trading session in New York 4.65% lower. Uber granted licence to operate in London Uber to list New York City yellow taxis in app In 2016, as it faced tough competition in China, Uber sold its business in the world's second largest economy to Didi in exchange for an 18% stake in the Beijing-headquartered firm. Didi's US market valuation has fallen by more than 80% since its $4.4bn debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) last summer. Within days of the listing China's internet regulator ordered online stores not to offer Didi's app, saying it illegally collected users' personal data. In December, the company announcedplans to take its shares off the NYSEand move its listing to Hong Kong. This week, Didi revealed that it faced an investigation by the US stock market watchdog about its initial public offering (IPO). In 2018, when both firms were still privately owned, Uber sold its businesses in South East Asia to Grab for a 27.5% stake in the Singapore-based company. Grab's shares fell sharply in their debuton New York's Nasdaq trading platform in December last year. Its stock market valuation has dropped by almost 75% since the IPO, which was the largest ever US listing by a South East Asian firm.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber to list New York City yellow taxis in app,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60864889,,"After ravaging New York City's yellow cab industry, Uber is now taking steps to embrace it. The company will now list New York City yellow cabs on its app, a partnership Uber described as the latest step in a global effort to work with the taxi industry to unlock new markets. It already has similar arrangements in place in countries such as Spain, Germany, Austria and Turkey. Uber has been facing a driver shortage as it emerges from the pandemic. The deal will add about 14,000 taxi drivers licensed in New York City - one of its most important markets - to Uber's platform. Guy Peterson, director of business development for Uber, called it a ""win for drivers"". ""No longer do they have to worry about finding a fare during off-peak times to getting a street hail back to Manhattan when in the outer boroughs,"" he said. The number of rides in yellow taxis in New York has plunged since Uber launched in the city in 2011, as people opted for the ease of online booking. The collapse helped to push nearly a thousand drivers to file for bankruptcy in recent years. Under the partnership, the software companies that currently work with city-licensed cab drivers will integrate with Uber, which will take a cut of the fares. The companies did not say how much this would be. The offering will roll out to the public this spring. Riders hailing a yellow taxi via the app will pay fares comparable to an Uber X ride, according to a Wall Street Journal report that Uber confirmed. Shares in Uber rose on the news. But Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, said Uber should not make the mistake of thinking that this means its fights with drivers in New York are over. She said Uber typically pays about 15% less than what a driver could earn running the meter. ""The companies that tore up this industry need this more than the drivers do,"" said Ms Desai. ""The fare structure that is not enough for Uber drivers is also not going to be enough for yellow cab drivers."" Bruce Schaller, a New York-based consultant who has studied the growth of Uber in the city, said the deal would benefit drivers and customers by widening market access, while helping the city control the number of empty cars adding to pollution and congestion problems as they look for customers. ""I've always felt that these industries would converge,"" he said. ""This is probably sooner than one would have expected...but clearly the pandemic has turned everything upside down and people are trying to put things back together in a way that will work."" As Uber pursues this model in other cities, the firm may come to dominate the market even more, Mr Schaller said. But in New York City, he said hailing a taxi from the street was likely to remain an essential part of life. ""The street hail is still a big deal in New York,"" he added. Ryan Wanttaja, the acting head of New York's Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), which regulates the industry, said it was ""always interested in tools that can expand economic opportunities for taxi drivers"". ""We are excited about any proposal to more easily connect passengers with taxis and look forward to learning more about this agreement between Uber and the taxi apps and ensuring it complies with TLC rules,"" he said.

Pedestrians and cyclists were unable to cross Hammersmith Bridge for 11 months from August 2020 because of cracks. City Hall said the Department for Transport (DfT) sanctioned a plan to ferry people across, but the bridge reopened in July with costs continuing. It added the termination of the ferry contract was being finalised. The DfT said it was not anticipated that the bridge would need to be closed often enough or for long enough going forward for the ferry to remain a ""viable solution"". The 134-year-old bridge was closed entirely in summer 2020 after cracks in the structure worsened during a heatwave. Previously, it had been closed only to motor vehicles since April 2019. In February 2021, two companies, City Cruises and Uber Boat by Thames Clippers, submitted ""detailed bids"" to provide the temporary ferry service. Uber Boat by Thames Clipper won the contract and was supposed to start its service in the spring but this was pushed back to August due to ""additional time"" being needed. The bridge then reopened in July to pedestrians and cyclists. Details of the public money spent on the unused service since then emerged following a question to Mayor of London Sadiq Khan from Lib Dem London Assembly Member Caroline Pidgeon. This video can not be played Are London’s bridges deteriorating? In his reply on 21 December, the mayor said: ""During the intervening period Transport for London (TfL) sought to minimise costs associated with the temporary ferry. ""However, the taskforce led by the Department of Transport (DfT) requested that options be developed for how the service could be operated on a standby basis should it be required during the repair works on the bridge, so a small core team has had to be retained for this purpose. ""TfL has also had to pay the holding costs associated with the infrastructure for the ferry service. Together these costs amount to £80k for every four weeks since August 2021."" Mr Khan added: ""These payments have been met with funding provided by the DfT as part of the government's financial settlements in October 2020 and June 2021, which were ring-fenced for this purpose."" All four pedestals that help to hold up the bridge have cracks in them, the meeting heard He said the taskforce confirmed on 25 November a ferry would no longer be required during the bridge works. ""TfL notified Uber Boats by Thames Clippers of the decision on the same day and the contract termination details are currently being finalised,"" Mr Khan added. Richmond Park MP Sarah Olney estimated the final bill was approximately £400,000. The Lib Dem tweeted: ""Considering the devastating impact the closure of Hammersmith Bridge has had on the lives of my constituents, £400,000 (so far) really is an inexcusable amount of money.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber prices could rise 20% after UK ruling,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-59549789,,"Uber has said it may soon have to start charging its UK customers VAT at 20%, after a High Court judgement, pushing up the cost of rides. It comes after a judge ruled that UK private hire taxi operators must make contracts with their customers. It could have far-reaching consequences for the industry and other private hire firms may also have to add VAT. It follows a separate judgement this year which found Uber drivers should be treated as workers not contractors. At the time, Lord Justice Leggatt suggested this ruling meant that a private hire operator such as Uber had to enter into a contract with its customers when it accepted a booking, rather than the passenger only having a contract with the driver of the vehicle. Uber raises London fares by 10% Uber to pay $9m in sex-assault report settlement Unlike most private drivers, Uber is a VAT-registered business, so this would oblige the ride-hailing firm to start charging the tax. Uber went to the High Court seeking to challenge this, but the High Court has now upheld it. A spokesperson for Uber said: ""Every private hire operator in London will be impacted by this decision, and should comply with the Supreme Court verdict in full."" A spokesperson for Transport for London which regulates private hire operators in London said it ""notes"" the judgement. ""All operators will need to carefully consider the court's judgment and take steps to ensure that they comply with it, including considering whether any changes to their way of working are required,"" he added. The case referred to the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998 which only applies in the capital, but Uber and the App Drivers and Couriers Union, which was a defendant in the case, both expect the ruling to be followed by licencing authorities across the UK.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber to pay $9m in sex-assault report settlement,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-59522079,,"Uber is to pay $9m (£6.8m) to settle a complaint over its sexual-assault and harassment reporting in California. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) had told Uber to hand over information about assault and harassments - but it did not do so. At the time, Uber had argued it would be a ""shocking violation of privacy"" for victims. The payment - reduced from an initial $59m fine - will help fund passenger-safety promotion, CPUC said. The settlement between Uber, CPUC, and the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network (Rainn) brings to an end a dispute lasting almost two years, over whether Uber should hand over records about reported incidents involving its drivers. Uber had argued that disclosing such records publicly could be traumatic for those who had been assaulted and might discourage reports in the future - particularly because CPUC was asking for the names of all ""witnesses"" - which would include those attacked. Rainn had raised similar concerns about whether the California officials would be able to treat the sensitive information with appropriate care. Why is it so hard to find a minicab? US sues Uber for overcharging disabled people But the CPUC said it only needed the information ""under seal"" - meaning the details of each individual case would be kept secret. It suggested Uber's response was an ""effort to frustrate commission oversight"". In December 2020, a year on, CPUC initially fined Uber $59m (£44.5m) for refusing to comply. But following Uber's appeal, it agreedthis week's settlement,externalof $9m, as a result of which: $5m will be spent on ""victims of violence and sexual violence"", preferably those who were passengers $4m will be spent on addressing violence in the ""passenger carrier industry"" Uber will pay an extra $150,000 to the California state general fund Uber will also provide reports to California officials from now on, using ""unique identifiers"", rather than names, to protect the identities of individuals. It will also build an ""opt-in"" process for ""survivors"" who want to provide more information about what happened to state officials. In a statement, Uber said it was ""glad the full commission has adopted this agreement"", adding: ""Most importantly, we can move forward with a solution that preserves the privacy and agency of survivors."" CPUC said the reduction of the planned $59m fine was, in part, down to months of negotiations where ""all parties gain advantages and give concessions"". The ride-hailing app had been under pressure to disclose details about its safety record, and first published its US-based safety report in December 2019, with a promise to release a further report every two years. The 2021 edition has not yet been published. But the first report showed thatUber had nearly 6,000 reports of sexual assault in 2017 and 2018- a numberthe company pointed out was a tiny fraction,externalof the more than two billion rides it provided in that time.

The firm refused to be drawn on whether it will roll out the offering further across Canada and the US. Canada's marijuana market is worth around CAD$5bn (£3bn; $4bn) a year. Uber Eats users will have to verify their age on the app and then will be able to pick up their orders within an hour, the company said. Under Canadian law, although marijuana use has been legal since 2018, it is still illegal to deliver it. Uber has had its sights set on the booming cannabis market for some time now. In April, chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said the company will consider delivering cannabis once it is permitted under US law. Despite the sale of cannabis for recreational use becoming legal in Canada three years ago, illegal producers still control a large share of sales.  This is something the government has been trying to remedy. Uber said that its partnership with Tokyo Smoke will help adults in the country buy safe, legal cannabis, combatting illegal sellers. Tokyo Smoke is a cannabis company with stores across Canada Canada's cannabis market is forecast to continue expanding in the coming years with industry research firm BDS Analytics expecting sales to grow to $6.7bn by 2026.

In March, Uber insisted its fareswould not increaseafter losing a legal battle over UK drivers' status. A spokesperson said: ""We know people rely on Uber to book a safe trip around London and this small fare increase will help reduce wait times."" There are currently 45,000 Uber drivers in the capital, a shortfall of 20,000. A spike in demand of 20% since all legal restrictions were lifted during July is thought to be behind increased cancellations and longer waiting times. Why is it so hard to find a minicab? Is Uber already harming the traditional taxi? It is thought to be the company's first significant price increase in London since 2017. Uber will still collect a 25% ""service fee"" from drivers for each journey taken. Earlier this year, Uber said its 70,000 UK drivers would be guaranteed a minimum wage of £8.72 an hour, holiday pay and pensions. That followed aSupreme Court decisionthat Uber drivers must be treated as workers rather than self-employed. Last year,Uber was allowed to continue operatingin London despite what magistrates described as ""past failings"".

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber sued by Justice Department for overcharging disabled people,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-59242866,,"The US Justice Department (DoJ) is suing ride-hailing app Uber over allegations it has been overcharging disabled people. The DoJ claims Uber's ""wait time"" fees are discriminating against disabled passengers who need more than two minutes to get into a car. It says Uber needs to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). But Uber said wait time fees were not intended to apply to disabled riders and that it had been refunding fees. Kristen Clarke, assistance attorney general for the DoJ's civil rights division said the lawsuit aimed to send a ""powerful message that Uber cannot penalise passengers with disabilities simply because they need more time to get into a car"". Uber and other companies that provide transportation services ""must ensure equal access for all people, including those with disabilities,"" she added. Uber ordered to pay $1.1m to blind passenger Paralympian issues Uber wheelchair plea Why is it so hard to find a minicab? However, Uber said it disagreed that its policies were in violation of the the ADA. A spokesman said the company had been in talks with the DoJ before the ""surprising and disappointing"" lawsuit. Wait time fees were ""never intended for riders who are ready at their designated pickup location but need more time to get into the car"", he said. Uber had a policy of refunding wait time fees for disabled riders whenever they alerted the firm that they had been charged, the spokesman said. ""After a recent change last week, now any rider who certifies they are disabled will have fees automatically waived,"" he added. Uber began charging passengers for driver waiting times in 2016. The firm says riders are charged on average less than 60 cents, and that wheelchair-accessible trips or Uber Assist trips do not have any wait time fees by default. It is not the first time that Uber has found itself in hot water over disability issues. In April,it was ordered to pay a blind woman in San Francisco $1.1mafter she was refused rides on 14 occasions. In the UK, Paralympic medallist Jack Hunter-Spivey said in September that Uber and other taxi driversregularly drove off when they saw that he was a wheelchair user. A 2020 study by the University of Tennessee,externalfound that it takes 28% more income for a disabled person in the US to achieve the same standard of living as a non-disabled person. Maria Town, chief executive of the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), says there is a big difference between people with disabilities, and people who require assistance Maria Town, president and chief executive of the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), who has cerebral palsy, told the BBC that disabled people often face a ""disproportionate economic burden, often as a result of realities they cannot change nor control"". In addition to higher costs for health care, medical supplies and accessibility tools, the practice of applying extra fees for services, such as grocery delivery or rideshare wait times, adds an additional ""tax"" for disabled consumers, she said. Ending the practice of charging wait-time fees for disabled riders would be a ""step in the right direction toward economic equality and dignity"", Ms Town added. The AAPD said it had seen many cases where Uber drivers had driven away when they saw that the passenger was using a wheelchair, crutches, a walker or a service dog. ""The presence of disability alone sometimes is enough, it's a huge issue,"" Ms Town said, recalling an incident from 2017 concerninga man in Texas who had a genetic disorder,externalthat affected his appearance. She also said that it was unfair of Uber to expect disabled people to use only its wheelchair-accessible services or Uber Assist. ""It's not fair on a number of fronts - there's a limited supply of these cars on the road, but also people with disabilities may not want assistance,"" she stressed. Forcing someone to take an assist ride could cause ""some tense driver-rider interactions that are completely unnecessary,"" Ms Town said.

Under the trial service, customers in 12 London boroughs will be able to order items such as laptops and printer cartridges, with a £5 delivery charge. The three-month trial begins in the week starting 15 November. Currys said the 1,800 products on offer all weighed under 7kg and could fit within a courier's bag. With size dimensions limited to about L46cm x W35cm x D35cm, Currys said the biggest item available for super-fast delivery would be, for example, a coffee machine. Customers can order through the Currys website or app up to two hours before stores close. ""The world has shifted to a hybrid way of working and more customers are demanding greater convenience and speedier delivery to get their hands on tech,"" said Currys' chief operating officer, Mark Allsop. The move echoes the same-day and one-hour delivery options available at the major UK supermarkets and Amazon.

Eve Henrikson, Uber regional manager, said the company looks ""forward to expanding the partnership further"", but gave no more details about future plans.

Sales in the six months to the end of October were up 15% on a like-for-like basis on the same period two years ago, before the Covid-19 crisis. However, the retailer revealed business remains 1% below the same period a year ago, when demand soared as households looked to update their in-home technology whilst stuck inside during the various lockdowns. There was strong growth in electrical goods, which offset a fall in mobile phone sales. Currys also played down any concerns over supply chain issues and staff shortages, saying it had ""put in place measures to mitigate the well-publicised"" disruption across the UK.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Legal action over alleged Uber facial verification bias,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-58831373,,"Two unions are taking legal action against Uber, alleging that software used to verify drivers' identity is racially biased, and the firm has unfairly dismissed drivers. The unions claim the Microsoft facial verification system used is worse at identifying people with darker skin. Uber says it protects passengers by ensuring the right person is driving, and there is ""robust human review"". Microsoft declined to comment on an ongoing legal case. This week the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) backed an employment tribunal claim for indirect racial discrimination on behalf of one of its members whose account, it says, was terminated following a facial verification error. The IWGB isasking Uber,externalto scrap the use of the technology. It follows a decision by the App Drivers & Couriers Union (ADCU) earlier this year, to bring two employment tribunal cases against Uber. The two drivers are supported by the Equality and Human Rights Commission., which told the BBC: ""A person's race should not be a barrier to using technology in any part of their life, including for their livelihood. ""We are supporting the drivers in their cases against Uber as part of our work to challenge race discrimination, including the use of potentially discriminatory AI in automated decision making."" Somestudies have shown,externalthat face recognition systems have higher error rates for darker-skinned people. Uber calls the system it uses to verify drivers' identity ""Real-Time ID Check"". The system is designed to stop drivers sharing accounts, in part because drivers must go through criminal record checks to get a private hire licence. Uber told the BBC it protected the ""safety and security of everyone who uses the Uber app by helping ensure the correct driver is behind the wheel"". ""The system includes robust human review to make sure that this algorithm is not making decisions about someone's livelihood in a vacuum, without oversight"", the firm said. It has said it is committed to fighting racism and championing equality. Before starting work, a driver submits a selfie to Uber which it then checks for a match against the account photo in its records. Ubersays,externaldrivers can choose whether their selfie is checked by Microsoft software, or by humans. If the photo does not match automatically, then there is a human review, it says. If the human review agrees there is not a match, the driver is ""waitlisted"" for 24 hours. The next time a driver logs on, a further human review is carried out. If there is still no match then the driver's account is deactivated. Drivers may appeal against the decision. Pictures and selfies submitted by courier Pa Edrissa Manjang. who is taking legal action against Uber Eats, supported by the ADCU In June the ADCUlaunched legal action,externalover what it alleges was theunfair dismissal,externalof a driver and an Uber Eats courier after the company's facial recognition system failed to identify them. James Farrar, the union's General Secretary, said that Uber had introduced a flawed facial recognition technology which generates ""unacceptable failure rates when used against a workforce mainly composed of people of colour"". According to Transport for London, 94% of licensed private hire drivers are black, Asian and minority ethnic. Microsoft declined to comment, citing pending legal action, but in a letter to the ADCU in April, the company wrote that it was ""consistently testing and updating our Face API with particular attention to fairness and accuracy across demographic groups"". ""We have also developed new practices, research methods, and tools to enable our customers to assess and mitigate unfairness in AI systems,"" it said. Uber stresses that if the algorithm finds a mismatch, the decision is subject to human review. But Pa Edrissa Manjang, one of the two people supported by the ADCU to bring an action against Uber, found the fact that humans had not spotted that his selfies matched ""mindboggling"", and questioned their professionalism. ""It's hard to get that wrong"", he said, ""but in my case they have got that wrong"". The other person supported by the union to  bring a tribunal case, Imran Javaid Raja, successfully contested Uber's decision, but lost his private hire licence following his dismissal.

Jamie Heywood and GMB's Gary Smith seek to end years of discord over the ride-hailing giant's business practices. Uber recognised the union for the first time in Mayafter the Supreme Court ruled its drivers should be classed as workers and entitled to better rights. The bosses said ""the exploitation"" of all ride-hailing drivers must stop. In a joint statement ahead of the meeting, Uber and GMB said an estimated 230,000 drivers were not receiving ""their legal rights"" from companies such as Bolt and Addison Lee. Uber 'willing to change' as drivers get minimum wage However, Addison Lee boss Liam Griffin rejected the claims, saying drivers were ""at the heart"" of his business. ""We guarantee the drivers that work with us get the London Living Wage level of earnings, as opposed to only the National Minimum Wage paid by Uber,"" he said. ""Drivers working with Addison Lee also get access to a pension and holiday pay."" Bolt said record numbers continued to earn through Bolt ""because they can take home more money"". ""We don't take business advice from competitors motivated by their own agenda,"" it added. Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam spearheaded a battle that began six years ago to grant Uber drivers worker status Separately, the former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, who spearheaded the Supreme Court case against Uber, accused the ride hailing giant of running a ""propaganda"" campaign. The App Drivers & Couriers Union (ADCU) leaders accused the firm of failing to implement the court's ruling by not paying drivers for waiting time, which they said made up 40% of drivers' working hours. The BBC has approached Uber for a comment. Under the May deal between Uber and GMB, the union will be able to represent up to 70,000 Uber drivers across the UK in discussions over earnings, pensions, benefits and their health and wellbeing. The agreement came after Uber lost the third and final stage of a five-year legal battle with drivers who claimed it had wrongly classified their employment status. For years, Uber resisted calls to recognise unions, which had criticised the firm for not granting drivers basic rights such as sick pay or a minimum wage. It argued it was a third-party booking agent, and its drivers were self-employed, but the Supreme Court ruled its drivers were workers, a category that means they are entitled to minimum legal, holiday and pension rights. Mr Smith, GMB's general secretary, said the deal with Uber was the ""first step towards a fairer working life for millions of people"". ""It showed that when companies and trade unions work together, standards can be raised across these industries,"" he said He said the Supreme Court ruling had set a precedent for all ride-hailing apps and urged others to follow. ""GMB and Uber today take the next step in our commitment to ending the exploitation of hundreds of thousands of ride-hailing app drivers,"" Mr Smith said. Jamie Heywood, Uber's regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe, said he hoped working with GMB would ""show the rest of the industry what can be achieved"". ""We may not seem like obvious allies, but together we made history by striking a recognition agreement to improve workers' protections and, crucially, give drivers a stronger say in how Uber operates,"" he added. Mr Heywood told the BBC that UK employment law had been ""extremely ambiguous"" on issues such as who was an employee and who was self-employed. The Supreme Court had now ""clarified"" the law and given Uber the ""mechanism"" that it needed to act, he said. When it was put to him that Uber had spent years exploiting that very ambiguity, he denied the charge, saying the firm was now able to ""keep the flexibility that workers value, but also provide them with the protection that they deserve"". On the issue of whether Uber Eats riders would receive the same protection, Mr Heywood said he was ""committed to providing good flexible work across both our Eats and our rides business"". However, he said the law was different for people in the Eats business, since the Court of Appeal had ruled in June that Deliveroo riders were self-employed and not employees of the company. Employment experts and unions have heralded Uber's deal with GMB as a big step forward for workers' rights that would be felt across the gig economy. However, the UK is the only country in which Uber has recognised a union, and it is still being challenged by drivers in other markets over similar issues. Mr Griffin, chief executive of Addison Lee, said a decline in driver earnings and wellbeing across the industry was a ""product of Uber's operating practices and predatory pricing model"", which had led to a race to the bottom and threatened driver livelihoods. Responding to the comments, Uber said its drivers were making ""more than ever before driving with Uber, so the claim of a race to the bottom is totally untrue"".

Didi's shares have slumped since their US market debut less than a month ago. That's after a series of actions by Chinese authorities spooked investors. By selling 45 million shares in Uber the SoftBank Vision Fund will cut its stake in the company by around a third. The Japanese technology investment group has lost a total of around $4bn on its stake in Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi, according to CNBC. However, Reuters news agency reported that SoftBank's decision to cut its Uber stake was unrelated to the slump in Didi's value and it just felt now was a good time to take some profits. In 2018, SoftBank poured around $7.6bn into Uber and added another $333m to that investment the following year. SoftBank is Didi's largest shareholder, with a stake of more than 20%. Uber also owns an almost 13% of Didi after the US-based company sold its operations in China to its local rival five years ago.

""While Uber and GMB may not seem like obvious allies, we've always agreed that drivers must come first, and today we have struck this important deal to improve workers' protections,"" said Jamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern and Eastern Europe. For years Uber resisted calls to recognise unions, which had criticised the firm for not granting drivers basic rights such as sick pay or a minimum wage. Uber had argued its drivers were freelancers and not entitled to these benefits. But in March it changed its stance after the Supreme Court ruled that its drivers should be classified as workers - a category entitling them to better pay and conditions. Uber 'willing to change' as drivers get minimum wage Now it provides them with a National Living Wage guarantee, holiday pay and a pension. And by recognising GMB, the ride-hailing giant has gone a step further, giving a union the right to negotiate on behalf of drivers for the first time. The two sides will meet quarterly to discuss driver issues and concerns while Uber has agreed access rights for GMB representatives at driver hubs. Under the agreement, GMB and Uber will discuss topics such as Uber's National Living Wage guarantee, pensions and holiday pay. Drivers won't automatically become members, and to be represented by the union, they will have to sign up. GMB called on other operators to follow suit, saying the deal offered a golden opportunity to improve workers' rights. ""This agreement shows gig economy companies don't have to be a Wild West on the untamed frontier of employment rights,"" said Mr Rix. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the agreement would give Uber drivers ""a real voice at work"". Uber worker benefits 'will make a difference' But the organisation that brought the Supreme Court employment case against Uber, the App Drivers & Couriers Union (ADCU), said there was ""good reason for workers and their unions to be cautious"". It said Uber was still not providing a minimum wage for all working time and holiday pay in the UK, ""despite the recent UK Supreme Court ruling in our favour"". ""At this time ADCU is not prepared to enter into a recognition agreement with Uber,"" it added. The UK is the only country in which Uber has recognised a union, and its is still being challenged by its drivers in many other markets over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed.

They will be available within the next two weeks through the taxi firms' apps until 4 July as part of government efforts to increase vaccine take-up,the White House announced on Tuesday,external. It comes as demand for jabs in the US has slowed in recent weeks. The boss of Uber said: ""Vaccines are our best hope to beat this pandemic"". Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi added: ""This is a proud moment for me, for Uber, and for our country. More and more Americans continue to get vaccinated every day - let's keep moving forward, together."" President Joe Biden has saidhe would like to see 70% of US adults receive at least one vaccine dose in time for 4 July Independence Day celebrations. As of Monday, 46% of Americans have received at least one vaccine dose, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The new initiatives come at a time when US demand for vaccines has declined significantly, forcing the administration to figure out new ways to motivate people to get vaccinated. The free rides from the ride-hailing apps werehighlighted by the White House,externalas part of efforts to help the vaccine roll-out. Neither will be paid by the government to transport people to and from the sites, but said they will pick up the costs themselves. Covid vaccine: Biden aims to expand vaccines for adults and children Covid vaccines: How fast is progress around the world? A new feature will launch in about two weeks on both apps, which will allow customers to get a code they can use to get rides to and from a vaccination site after providing some details. Uber and Lyft have previously announced free rides to vaccine clinics would be available to vulnerable communities lacking healthcare and transportation at increased risk of Covid-19. But the new offer will be available to all US residents with a vaccine appointment. US demand for vaccines has declined significantly Lyft said that its code would cover $15 (£10.60) each way, and it expects that would cover ""most, if not all, of riders' fares"". Its co-founder and president John Zimmer said: ""The vaccine is the key to getting us all moving again, and we're proud to do our part to move the country forward. ""We've always believed transportation has the power to improve people's lives, and this initiative makes that truer than ever."" An Uber spokeswoman told the BBC that more details would be announced for its app in the coming weeks. Both transport firms also confirmed that the offer would not have an impact on drivers' take-home pay. The partnership comes after Uber sent a letter to the Biden team in December, offering help with vaccinations. It also urged the administration to maintain Uber drivers' status as independent contractors, while offering the ability to provide some benefits. Mr Biden campaigned on providing more benefits to gig workers by reclassifying them as employees, which the companies involved are against. The rides build on existing schemes Uber and Lyft launched at the end of last year, which help the public but also the companies as they seek to have drivers and riders return to the road. Uber had offered 10 million self-funded free or discounted rides to vaccination sites, while Lyft said it would provide an uncapped amount of free vaccination rides paid for in partnership with other corporate sponsors. Mr Biden also will announce funding through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for states for on-the-ground efforts to promote vaccinations, such as phone banking and door-to-door canvassing. The announcement follows attempts by other companies to encourage customers to get vaccinated. McDonald's announced on Tuesday that in the US it would start printing ""We can do this"" slogans, alongside links to websites with further information about vaccines, on its coffee cups. Consumer giant Unilever will also be giving away milkshakes and ice creams to healthcare workers and those getting vaccinated across several US sites on 14 May.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Grab: How an Uber killer became a powerful Asian super-app,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56967633,,"When Microsoft's Bill Gates said in 1994 that ""banking is necessary, banks are not"", financiers and analysts alike dismissed the claims as the wild musings of an over-imaginative techie. Fast forward a few decades and that vision is fast becoming reality. Grab is one of the most dominant super apps in Asia, offering rides, food delivery and now, financial services. That includes loans, insurance, payments and investments - all accessed through a mobile phone app. Launched in 2012 as a ride-hailing app like Uber, Grab has since expanded broadly. In 2018, it pushed Uber out of South East Asia. Grab set for $40bn valuation in US share listing Chinese regulators rein in fintech platforms Is Alibaba's fate a warning to China’s tech giants? Grab's goal is to eventually transform into a virtual bank for South East Asia's 600 million strong population. But increased competition and governments seeking to curb the influence of powerful super apps could get in the way of those ambitions. Grab started life in Malaysia in 2012, as an online taxi booking service initially calledMyTeksi,external. Co-founder Anthony Tan had the idea when he was studying at Harvard Business School. The pitch was to make taxi rides safer and more convenient for Malaysians. But first they needed investors. This video can not be played ""We're not sellers, we're buyers"" Kee Lock Chua is a Managing Partner at Vertex Ventures Southeast Asia and India, and one of the first institutional investors in Grab. The other investor? Anthony Tan's mum. ""We saw how he spent time with his mum, how he talked to her, and how much respect he gave her,"" Mr Chua explained. ""That told us he had strong character and conviction."" ""Besides the solid idea, that helped us to make the decision to invest in the business."" Mr Chua's firm invested $11.2m (£8.1m) in Grab, giving Vertex Ventures Southeast Asia and India a 22% stake in the company. He exited the investment seven years later, making more than 10 times that amount. As Grab's popularity grew, the company realised many of its drivers didn't have bank accounts. The head of Grab Financial Group Reuben Lai had to help drivers sign up for accounts so they could get paid and also arrange loans for their cars. ""After doing that for a number of years, we started asking ourselves, 'why are we doing [this]?"" he said. ""That was when we realised that six out of 10 people across South East Asia are underserved by banks."" ""It could be a lack of data [or] it could be the high costs of serving them."" ""We want to be...the platform that enables financial institutions to serve this emerging consumer. That includes Natthakan Khingpat in Bangkok, who opened his restaurant during the first wave of Covid-19 last year. He gets the bulk of his orders from the Grab app and has been lucky: business is brisk. He needed to borrow money to expand but going to a traditional bank was never an option. ""If I were to pay for the high monthly interest rates, I [don't] think I could survive,"" he told the BBC. Grab has loaned Mr Natthakan almost $4,000 and the repayments are deducted from his daily earnings. ""I could go in [to the app] and look at how much per day I had to pay back. ""I thought I would be able to pull it off….it felt almost like I wasn't taking out a loan."" Many of the firm's first customers for its financial services were drivers. Boon Kok has driven a Grab car for three years and now takes out health insurance through the app. Grab driver Boon Kok uses the app's insurance services. ""Every single drive I take, [the app] will deduct 10 cent(s) so I think it's very affordable,"" he says. He's now got coverage worth $113,000. The company is now looking to target digitally savvy millennials. Jixun Foo, a Managing Partner of GGV Capital and another early investor in the company, said his advice to Grab's leadership was to get into financial services from the start. ""Once you have your [digital] wallet you start to use it,"" he told me. ""Then it is natural that you use it to buy things, you want to access better credit [and] when you are travelling you may want to buy travel insurance along with it."" ""It's just the natural next step."" Grab has followed the Chinese model, leveraging on its customer base and offering financial services to them. Chinese investors in Grab - including hailing app Didi Chuxing and tech giant Tencent - provided both expertise and financing. But regulators in China haverecently cracked downon the powerful tech industry, in an attempt to rein them in. ""In China, the government was less aware of how the concentration of power could happen,"" says Professor Nitin Pangarkar from the National University of Singapore's Business School. ""Other governments are seeing that this happened in China and if they don't want to let it happen in their own countries they have to step in and regulate,"" he adds. The risks to Grab are also mounting. It won a digital bank license in Singapore and is hoping to launch in 2022, but analysts say regulation will be a key concern going forward. ""I think digital banking in south east Asia is going to be tough, because regulators will definitely be protective of their turf,"" Robson Lee, partner at Gibson Dunn tells me. It also has plans to list in the US later this year, with a valuation of $40bn. ""They have forecasted very good numbers but I think the devil is in the details,"" Mr Lee said. ""I think investors have got to continue to be vigilant and watch this very carefully.""

During the eight-minute journey, Victoria White's waters broke and her daughter's head emerged. At the entrance to Whittington Hospital, Ms White gave one more push and her baby - who has not yet been named - was born. ""It didn't quite make sense in my head that I'd given birth. You usually have a time to prepare yourself,"" she said. Ms White first felt contractions at 03:00 BST on Saturday. She called the hospital but it was decided she would wait a little longer before going in, as the contractions were 10 minutes apart. By 03:45 they had become more frequent so it was decided she should go in. ""I thought I had time because it took three days from this point for my previous child to be born but about three minutes in to the Uber journey, I said to my husband: 'I feel like I need to push.' ""You have no control over your body at that point. I felt a pushing sensation and pushed and I told my husband that something's burst and that was my waters breaking all over the Uber. ""Just as the Uber was arriving at the hospital I could feel that I had delivered my daughter's head. The family haven't decided on a name for their newborn daughter ""I managed to take about five steps from the Uber and managed to get to the hospital entrance and the receptionist looked at me and shouted: 'I'll get a midwife!' ""Immediately three midwives came running towards me. I think they brought a wheelchair and they said something like crouch down and I just replied, 'It's here, it's coming' as that's all I could manage."" Immediately afterwards Ms White gave one final push and her daughter was born. ""After that push there was just this silence: my body stopped, the pain stopped, the contractions stopped and I just turned to my husband and I think I just said to him: 'What on earth just happened?' We were both in shock. My body was shaking for a good hour afterwards."" Victoria White's daughter was born at the Whittington Hospital in Archway She added: ""The whole thing took about 10 minutes. According to my Uber app, I got into it at 04:15. According to the hospital she was born at 04:25."" Afterwards, her thoughts turned to the Uber driver. ""Usually you say, 'Hello, how are you?'... we didn't even have any conversations with him or anything other than me shouting at him 'It's coming, it's coming'. ""When we got out the Uber we didn't thank him for anything; we were obviously in a rush and we just left him and his water burst-stained car. I was concerned, once my head and brain had caught up - I hope he's OK and that it hadn't traumatised him."" Ms White's post on LinkedIn caught Uber's attention The next day Ms White contacted him through the Uber app to thank him. ""I said, 'I'm the woman who basically ruined your car last night' - can I cover the costs of cleaning? He was like, 'No, no, congratulations, it was my pleasure, I'm so glad everything was OK, I don't need anything.'"" She added: ""He grasped the emergency. He didn't potter around or drive slowly. He did exactly what we needed him to do. ""If it had taken two minutes longer it would have been a lot more dangerous because none of us know how to deliver a baby.""

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber ordered to pay $1.1m to blind woman refused rides,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56583428,,"Uber argued it was not liable because its drivers are contractors Uber has been ordered to pay $1.1m (£795,000) to a blind woman who was refused rides on 14 occasions. Lisa Irving said on some occasions, drivers were verbally abusive, or harassed her about transporting her guide dog, Bernie, in the car. One driver allegedly cut her trip short after falsely claiming to have arrived at her destination. An independent arbitrator ruled Uber's drivers had illegally discriminated against her due to her condition. It rejected Uber's claim that the company itself was not liable, because, it argued, its drivers had the status of contractors rather than employees. Mrs Irving, from San Francisco, said she had worried about her safety after being stranded multiple times late at night due to being rejected by drivers. She also alleged that cancelled rides also led to her being late for work, which contributed to her being fired from her job. The behaviour from drivers continued despite her complaining to Uber, she said. Uber worker benefits 'will make a difference' Uber and Lyft to swap data on banned drivers A spokesman for Mrs Irving said: ""Of all Americans who should be liberated by the rideshare revolution, the blind and visually impaired are among those who stand to benefit the most. ""The bottom line is that under the Americans with Disabilities Act, a guide dog should be able to go anywhere that a blind person can go."" In a statement issued to media following the ruling, a spokesman for Uber said the company is ""proud"" of the help it offers blind passengers. ""Drivers using the Uber app are expected to serve riders with service animals and comply with accessibility and other laws, and we regularly provide education to drivers on that responsibility. ""Our dedicated team looks into each complaint and takes appropriate action,"" he added. It is not the first time Uber has faced a legal battle from the blind community. In 2014, The National Federation of the Blind in the US sued the ride-sharing app over guide-dog regulations. The case was settled in 2017 when Uber agreed to ensure its drivers knew they were legally obliged to provide service to people with guide dogs. ""I'm sorry it came to this,""Mrs Irving told the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper,external. ""I would have preferred that my civil rights be respected. But it sends a strong message that this is not acceptable."" Taxi drivers 'missing out on Covid payments' Uber drivers are workers not self-employed..."
BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber worker benefits 'will make a difference',https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56428861,,"After a long court case fought by Uber drivers to get recognition as workers, the company has offered holiday pay, a guaranteed minimum wage, and pensions benefits to its drivers. But what do Uber drivers think of the outcome of the case? Reactions range from welcoming it as a good thing to anger and disappointment that Uber has not gone further. Abul Kalam says Uber drivers should be treated like any other freelancers Abul Kalam, an Open University student who wants a career in education, uses Uber work in London to bring in some money. He says the concessions from the firm are ""valuing the tremendous work that Uber drivers have done over the last difficult year"". He says Ubers have transported key workers to and from their jobs and ""any holiday pay will be a welcome gesture"". ""The pensions are an added bonus,"" he says. However, he views Uber drivers as providing a freelance service, and says they shouldn't be paid while they are waiting for fares. ""Everyone should be entitled to the same benefits. It's greatly welcome, but why should we be treated differently?"" he says. Abul added that he can't see why Uber is guaranteeing a minimum wage. ""I can't ever be on a job for an hour and not be getting £8,"" he says. Zafar Iqbal says the Uber concessions will help drivers Zafar Iqbal stopped working for Uber in October last year after a dispute over pay. The Birmingham-based taxi driver could not make Uber work financially, especially with the family commitments that he has. ""The fare was always too little,"" he says, and the commission was ""not cheap"". ""Taxi costs are rising day after day and they [Uber] keep the fares low,"" he says. ""If you go outside the city you're unlikely to get a fare back."" He says the Uber concessions on holiday pay and pensions ""will make a difference, and it will help"". He adds that taxis are ""really struggling at the moment - there is not much work available"". Abduzak Hadi said the pandemic had made it hard for drivers to make ends meet Abduzak Hadi, who is based in London, was one of the claimants in the court case against Uber. He says that Uber has not gone far enough in its concessions, and that the Supreme Court ruling directed Uber to pay drivers from when they logged onto the app, not from when they accepted a job. ""Uber has flooded the market with drivers because it costs them nothing,"" he said. ""I started work at 7 o'clock this morning, and I've only taken £20."" He said the holiday pay entitlement was 12.07% after expenses, which are significant. ""In reality, it will not make any difference,"" he says. ""I'm still out here putting in long hours."" He said the pandemic had made it hard for drivers to make ends meet. ""I've been getting loans, and any savings we had are long gone. I'm in debt at the moment and rent is outstanding,"" he said.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber pay changes: Gig economy workers on what it could mean for them,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-56433922,,"Eyes are on companies that employ gig economy workers, after Uberannouncedit will pay all UK workers minimum wage, holiday pay and pensions. It comes a month after it lost a legal battle in the UK over drivers' status. Some workers in the gig economy have told Radio 1 Newsbeat they want their companies to follow in Uber's footsteps. Uber drivers give mixed response to benefits news Gig economy workers are usually on short-term contracts or freelancers, and often don't get things like holiday pay or pensions. Depending on how you look at it, the gig economy offers lots of flexibility for its workers - or it's exploitative and offers little job security. Ethan Bradley is a 27-year-old bicycle courier for food delivery companies. He says Uber's new promise is a step in the ""right direction,"" and hopes his employer will follow suit. ""Having a guaranteed minimum wage would mean that I'm able to plan a budget for my bills and my expenses"", he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""I wouldn't have to worry on a day to day basis if I'm going to be able to make the rent this month."" Being a food courier is Ethan's full time job. He is paid per delivery, rather than per hour. He says he often makes less than minimum wage and waits ""hours at a time without a single order"". Ethan works for three different food delivery companies Ethan can sympathise with Uber drivers who have been calling for better workers' rights for years. Being a gig worker is a ""very anxious existence,"" he says. ""When it is quiet, and you're stood around on street corners all day, waiting for your phone to ping off for a job to come up. ""You don't know if those jobs are ever going to come and then you start panicking."" Will other companies follow Uber and change workers' benefits? The unpredictable nature of the pay has made budgeting difficult for Ethan. ""I have struggled to pay the rent and my bills a number of times, especially over the last year since the pandemic started. We don't have a safety net."" Ethan says there's ""no reason"" to ""deny rights to the workers that have built these enterprises"". ""These companies are part of a multinational, multibillion pound industry and they can afford it at the end of the day."" Fran works in a similar role, for a company which delivers things like takeaways and groceries. They have chronic health conditions, and were attracted to the job on the basis of ""flexible"" working. Although things started off well when Fran started their job, they said ""things have definitely declined"". Fran says the company ""changed the rules about zones and bonus payments that we got. ""Over time, things changed to a point where I really wasn't earning enough to sustain myself. ""It spiralled to the point now where I've amassed quite a bit of debt."" Fran works as a courier in the gig economy On a typical shift Fran gets £4.50 per job, though they can sometimes opt in for a shift where there's a guaranteed rate of £8 an hour regardless of the number of deliveries. But they say that's not enough, ""considering the expenses that I have to pay. ""My insurance, for example, is around £2 an hour. So I'm going to knock that off whatever I earn. ""I'm definitely earning less than minimum wage - far less."" Fran hopes they will see more gig workers getting better rights. ""Uber is one of the big ones, I think it this does set a precedent for the whole gig economy. ""I'm hoping that it's going to maybe cause a little bit of a domino effect upon these companies."" Because of their chronic illness, Fran says sick pay would be particularly important to them. ""Right now, I've just been signed off sick from work. So my income... is literally zero. ""If I'm off sick for a week, with a flare up with my health, I don't get paid for that week. And when you're chronically ill, you tend to have a lot of sick days."" They said it would ""mean a lot"" to them to have more support on sick days.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,"Uber 'willing to change' as drivers get minimum wage, holiday pay and pensions",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56412397,,"This video can not be played Jamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern Europe at Uber, says the firm has found a ""path forward"" Uber has insisted its fares will not rise after saying that its 70,000 UK drivers will be guaranteed a minimum wage, holiday pay and pensions. The ride-hailing giant said drivers would earn at least the National Living Wage, or £8.72 an hour, in a move that could shake up the wider gig economy. It comes a month after it lost a legal battle in the UK over drivers' status. Uber said it was ""turning the page"" on workers' rights, but some said it had not gone far enough. Analysts also warned the company had increased prices in California after a similar ruling and was likely to do the same in the UK. Writing in the Evening Standard, Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said: ""This is a significant improvement in the standard of work for UK drivers. But I know many observers won't pat us on the back for taking this step, which comes after a five-year legal battle. ""They have a point, though I hope the path that we chose shows our willingness to change."" Union leaders and employment experts said Uber's move would have far reaching consequences for the gig economy. Bates Wells lawyer Rachel Mathieson, who represented Uber drivers fighting for worker rights, called it ""a very significant milestone"". However, one union complained Uber would still not pay drivers for the time they spent waiting in between jobs. The changes also do not apply to couriers in its food delivery business, Uber Eats, who remain self-employed. In February, Uber lost the third and final stage of a five-year legal battle with drivers who claimed it had wrongly classified their employment status. It argued it was a third-party booking agent, and its drivers were self-employed. Uber drivers are workers not self-employed But the Supreme Court ruled its drivers were workers, a category that means they are entitled to minimum legal, holiday and pension rights. Uber was not legally obliged to grant these benefits across its business, but it was facing further action from drivers as well as calls for compensation for past missed entitlements. The company is also being challenged by its drivers in many other countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed. Uber, which is worth $110bn but has never made a profit, said the changes to its UK drivers' pay would come in from Wednesday, and form an earnings floor, not an earnings ceiling. The company said the new rates would come on top of free insurance to cover sickness, injury and maternity and paternity payments which have been in place for all drivers since 2018. Uber says: It will pay at least the National Living Wage for over-25s,irrespective of a driver's age, after accepting a trip request and after expenses All drivers will be paid holiday time based on 12.07% of their earnings, paid out on a fortnightly basis Drivers will automatically be enrolled into a pension plan with contributions from Uber alongside driver contributions, setting drivers up over the long term It will continue free insurance in case of sickness or injury as well as parental payments, which have been in place for all drivers since 2018 All drivers will retain the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam spearheaded a battle that began six years ago to grant Uber drivers worker status Jamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern Europe at Uber, said: ""Uber is just one part of a larger private-hire industry, so we hope that all other operators will join us in improving the quality of work for these important workers who are an essential part of our everyday lives. ""Drivers have consistently told us that they wanted both the flexibility that we provided but also they wanted the benefits and we've been struggling to find a way of bringing those two together in a way that work for us and work for drivers,"" he said. Uber pointed out in its statement announcing the changes that a worker is a classification that is unique under UK employment law. Workers are not full-blown employees but are entitled to the minimum wage, holiday pay and a pension. The company said the recent UK Supreme Court ruling had provided a clearer path forward as to a model that gives drivers the rights of worker status - while continuing to let them work flexibly. Lawyers and union leaders said Uber's move will spark change across the gig economy Boss of the TUC union body, Frances O'Grady, said the announcement was ""really important because it shows that no multi-national company however big is above the law"". But she suggested Uber was trying to ""cherry pick"" from the Supreme Court's ruling, which said Uber should consider its drivers as workers from the time they logged onto the app, until they logged off. Instead it will only commit to these entitlements from the time a trip is accepted to the drop-off. James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, the two former drivers who sued Uber over worker status, said the company was still ""short changing [drivers] to the tune of 40-50%"". ""Also, it is not acceptable for Uber to unilaterally decide the driver expense base in calculating minimum wage. This must be subject to collective agreement,"" they said. Others pointed out that Uber had said nothing about compensating drivers for past entitlements they had missed out on. Despite the reservations, employment experts and unions heralded Uber's announcement as a big step forward for workers' rights that would be felt across the gig economy. Nigel McCay of law firm Leigh Day, which represented Uber drivers in the recent court battles, told the BBC: ""We see so many other operators using this employment model which is questionable. ""And they'll now see this decision and think: 'Hang on, if Uber have had to finally give in and accept that the drivers are workers then how long are we going to be able to sustain an argument that our workers shouldn't be entitled to those rights?'"" Uber competitor Bolt told the BBC it had no plans to change its driver's conditions, as they ""already make more with Bolt compared to other ride-hailing companies because our commission rates are lower"". However, it said it would continue to consult with its 50,000 UK drivers to make sure ""any changes we make directly benefit them"". Mary Walker, partner and employment lawyer at law firm Gordons, said the additional costs facing the gig economy mean ""some businesses will simply be unable to continue trading"". Other firms will be able to restructure, but perhaps with fewer workers, she added. Union leaders also warned other gig economy firms they would have to change. ""This is the end of the road for bogus self employment,"" said Mick Rix, national officer of the GMB union, which has been fighting for employment rights through the courts. ""It's a shame it took the GMB winning four court battles to make them see sense, but we got there in the end and ultimately that's a big win for our members. Other gig economy companies should take note,"" Mr Rix said. Union reps could barely contain their delight at Uber's announcement. After years of court battles, they portray this as a win of David over Goliath. And they are hopeful it might create a domino effect. Other gig economy companies have likely been looking closely at the Supreme Court's verdict in February. The fact that Uber has chosen to fundamentally change its system rather than fight on might encourage others to do the same.

Malaysia King, 24, is facing several charges including ""assault with a caustic chemical"", police said. Ms King is one of three passengers captured in dashcam footage, one of whom appears to cough over the driver. Police said that a second suspect, 24-year-old Arna Kimiai, had informed them that she would hand herself in. ""We're glad to hear that Ms Kimiai intends to do the right thing,"" said Lt Tracy McCray of the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), adding: ""We hope it happens promptly."" The SFPD said that Ms King was arrested on Thursday with the assistance of Los Angeles police officers. The other charges that she faces include ""assault and battery"" and violating the city's health and safety laws. It said the investigation into the incident on the afternoon of Sunday 7 March was ongoing. Allegations made by Uber driver Subhakar Khadka, 32, include the refusal by his passengers to wear a face mask when requested, an attempt by one of the suspects to steal his mobile phone and the possible use of pepper spray, police said. Restrictions in place in San Francisco to help prevent the spread of Covid-19 include wearing a mask ""to cover your mouth and nose"" when within 2m (6ft) of someone who is not a member of your household, and when using public or ""business"" transportation. The footage, captured by a camera in the front of Mr Khadka's vehicle, shows three female passengers sitting in the back, two of whom at one point remove their face masks. The third passenger has not yet been named. One of them later appears to lean forward and cough towards Mr Khadka. She then reaches for a mobile phone in the front, to which he replies: ""Don't touch my property."" The same woman then removes Mr Khadka's own face mask, accusing him of driving them ""into the middle of nowhere"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reporting the incident, Mr Khadka told police that he had stopped driving just minutes after picking up his three passengers after noticing that one of them was not wearing a mask. He said that an ""altercation"" had occurred when he told them that he could not continue until they were correctly wearing their face coverings. When the three stepped out of the vehicle, one of them ""reached in to an open window and sprayed what is believed to be pepper spray"" towards him, police said. In a statement published on its website, the SFPD said the behaviour captured on camera portrayed ""a callous disregard for the safety and wellbeing of an essential service worker in the midst of a deadly pandemic,external"".

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber and Lyft to swap data on banned drivers,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56368058,,"Uber and rival app Lyft plan to share with each other the names of US drivers they ban from their platforms because of ""serious"" safety incidents, such as sexual assault. The two firms said the programme, to be managed by a background check company, was aimed at improving industry safety. They said other US firms could opt to participate. Both Uber and Lyft have faced scrutiny and legal action over their handling of sexual assault and other safety issues. They have responded to the criticism by introducing measures such as recurring background checks and new features, such as emergency buttons in their apps. The new programme, which is only active in the US, will also allow the two firms to share information about drivers involved in certain serious incidents such as rape and non-consensual kissing, as well as non-sexual physical assaults. Uber fined over withholding sexual assault records Uber: 6,000 US sexual assault reports in two years Scott Berkowitz, president and founder of the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, said the effort meant ""perpetrators will no longer be able to hide or escape accountability by simply switching ridesharing platforms"". ""By putting aside competition, they are placing users first and building a safer rideshare community for all,"" he said inthe announcement,externalshared by the companies on Thursday. Lawyer Kristen Barton of Estey & Bomberger, which represents women who have sued the ridesharing companies for inadequate protections from sexual violence, called the programme a ""step in the right direction"". But she cautioned that the database's usefulness would be limited by its focus on drivers that the companies have banned. ""There's no guarantee that when a report against a driver is lodged that that is being followed up on and resulting in deactivation by the companies,"" she said, adding that only a small number of people who are assaulted even report the incident. ""While it is a good start, it's just not going to capture enough information to stop assaults from occurring,"" she said. In 2019, Uber said it had received nearly 6,000 reports of sexual assault in the US in the previous two years. It said problems arose in a tiny fraction of the 2.3 billion rides during that time. It later clashed with state regulators in California, who wanted access to the reports, ultimately leading to a fine. Lyft has delayed publication of a similar report, citing the privacy disagreement. The company is also facing lawsuits from dozens of women in the US, who say they were harmed after the firm failed to protect passengers from its drivers. Lyft is active in the US and Canada. Uber, which operates in 71 countries around the world, said the data-sharing initiative was limited to the US, with no plans to expand at this time. The firm has faced concerns over its handling of safety incidents outside the US as well. In the UK, Uber had its London licence suspended, in part because of safety concerns. However, in September last year, Westminster Magistrates' Court ruled the firm could continue operating, saying it had improved its record despite ""historical failings"".

BBC,0.05855610077732243,"Uber drivers are workers not self-employed, Supreme Court rules",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56123668,,"Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam pose in front of the Supreme Court on Friday Uber drivers must be treated as workers rather than self-employed, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled. The decision could mean thousands of Uber drivers are entitled to minimum wage and holiday pay. The ruling could leave the ride-hailing app facing a hefty compensation bill, and have wider consequences for the gig economy. Uber said the ruling centred on a small number of drivers and it had since made changes to its business. In a long-running legal battle, Uber had finally appealed to the Supreme Court after losing three earlier rounds. Uber's share price dipped as US trading began on Friday as investors grappled with what impact the London ruling could have on the firm's business model. It is being challenged by its drivers in multiple countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed. Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam took Uber to an employment tribunal in 2016, arguing they worked for Uber. Uber said its drivers were self employed and it therefore was not responsible for paying any minimum wage nor holiday pay. The two,who originally won an employment tribunal against the ride hailing app giant in October 2016,told the BBC they were ""thrilled and relieved"" by the ruling. ""I think it's a massive achievement in a way that we were able to stand up against a giant,"" said Mr Aslam, president of the App Drivers & Couriers Union (ADCU). ""We didn't give up and we were consistent - no matter what we went through emotionally or physically or financially, we stood our ground."" Lord Leggatt said that the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed Uber's appeal Uber appealed against the employment tribunal decision but the Employment Appeal Tribunal upheld the ruling in November 2017. The company then took the case to the Court of Appeal, which upheld the ruling in December 2018. The ruling on Friday was Uber's last appeal, as the Supreme Court is Britain's highest court, and it has the final say on legal matters. Delivering his judgement, Lord Leggatt said that the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed Uber's appeal that it was an intermediary party and stated that drivers should be considered to be working not only when driving a passenger, but whenever logged in to the app. The court considered several elements in its judgement: Uber set the fare which meant that they dictated how much drivers could earn Uber set the contract terms and drivers had no say in them Request for rides is constrained by Uber who can penalise drivers if they reject too many rides Uber monitors a driver's service through the star rating and has the capacity to terminate the relationship if after repeated warnings this does not improve Looking at these and other factors, the court determined that drivers were in a position of subordination to Uber where the only way they could increase their earnings would be to work longer hours. Jamie Heywood, Uber's Regional General Manager for Northern and Eastern Europe, said: ""We respect the Court's decision which focussed on a small number of drivers who used the Uber app in 2016. ""Since then we have made some significant changes to our business, guided by drivers every step of the way. These include giving even more control over how they earn and providing new protections like free insurance in case of sickness or injury. ""We are committed to doing more and will now consult with every active driver across the UK to understand the changes they want to see."" Uber has long argued that it is a booking agent, which hires self-employed contractors that provide transport. By not being classified as a transport provider, Uber is not currently paying 20% VAT on fares. The Supreme Court ruled that Uber has to consider its drivers ""workers"" from the time they log on to the app, until they log off. This is a key point because Uber drivers typically spend time waiting for people to book rides on the app. Previously, the firm had said that if drivers were found to be workers, then it would only count the time during journeys when a passenger is in the car. ""This is a win-win-win for drivers, passengers and cities. It means Uber now has the correct economic incentives not to oversupply the market with too many vehicles and too many drivers,"" said James Farrar, ADCU's general secretary. ""The upshot of that oversupply has been poverty, pollution and congestion."" Mr Aslam, who claims Uber's practices forced him to leave the trade as he couldn't make ends meet, is considering becoming a driver for the app again. But he is upset that the ruling took so long. ""It took us six years to establish what we should have got in 2015. Someone somewhere, in the government or the regulator, massively let down these workers, many of whom are in a precarious position,"" he said. Uber drivers launch legal battle over 'favouritism' The Uber driver evicted from home and left to die of coronavirus Mr Farrar points out that with fares down 80% due to the pandemic,many drivers have been struggling financially,externaland feel trapped in Uber's system. ""We're seeing many of our members earning £30 gross a day right now,"" he said, explaining that the self-employment grants issued by the government only cover 80% of a driver's profits, which isn't even enough to pay for their costs. ""If we had these rights today, those drivers could at least earn a minimum wage to live on."" That remains to be seen, but it could potentially happen. When Uber listed its shares in the United States in 2019, its filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) included a section on risks to its business. The company said in this section that if it had to classify drivers as workers, it would ""incur significant additional expenses"" in compensating the drivers for things such as the minimum wage and overtime. ""Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition,"" it added. Uber also wrote in the filing that if Mr Farrar and Mr Aslam were to win their case, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) would then classify the firm as a transport provider, and Uber would need to pay VAT on fares. This relates to a judicial review filed by Jolyon Maugham QC in 2019. Mr Maugham, a barrister specialising in tax and employment law, applied to HMRC to ask for a judicial review and that HMRC demand that Uber pay VAT. ""I tried to force the issue by suing Uber for a VAT receipt, because I thought that, that way, even if HMRC didn't want to charge Uber, I would be able to force it to,"" he told the BBC. ""The Supreme Court has fundamentally answered two questions at the same time: one is whether drivers are workers for Uber, and the other is whether Uber is liable to pay VAT to HMRC,"" said Mr Maugham, who also heads up campaign group The Good Law Project. ""It makes it extremely difficult for Uber to continue to resist paying what I understand to be more than £1bn in VAT and interest."" HMRC and Uber are still in dispute about the firm's VAT liability. Tom Vickers is a senior lecturer in sociology at Nottingham Trent University and head of the Work Futures Research Group, which studies the jobs that people do and how they change over time. He thinks the Supreme Court's ruling has wider implications,externalfor a lot of other gig economy workers like other private hire drivers, couriers and delivery drivers. ""The central point for me is that the ruling focuses on the control that companies exercise over people's labour - this control also carries with it responsibilities for their conditions and wellbeing. ""This is even more important in the context of the pandemic."" As for Uber, Rachel Mathieson, senior associate at Bates Wells, which represented Mr Farrar and Mr Aslam, said her firm's position was that the ruling applies to all 90,000 drivers who have been active with Uber since and including 2016. ""Our position is that the ruling applies to all of their drivers at large,"" she said. Dr Alex Wood, an Internet Institute research associate on gig economy at Oxford University, disagrees. He told the BBC that because the UK doesn't have a labour inspectorate, these ""rules aren't enforced and it falls to workers to bring subsequent tribunals"". This means that ""in reality, it's very easy for Uber to just ignore this until more tribunals come for the remaining 40,000 [drivers]"".

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Groundbreaking biofuel rocket could be 'Uber for space',https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55845762,,"This video can not be played Stardust 1.0: Debut launch of first commercial rocket powered by bio-derived fuel Snow swirled and a biting wind sent temperatures plummeting to several degrees below zero as the Stardust 1.0 made its debut at a former military base in Maine. Strapped to a trailer and pulled by a pick-up truck along a runway once used by B-52 bombers in the Cold War, it wasn't the most glamorous entrance for a rocket about to make history. And it very nearly didn't as the subzero conditions played havoc with the electronics and clouds moved in. But after several delays and as the Sunday afternoon light waned, Stardust finally lifted off, becoming the first commercial launch of a rocket powered by bio-derived fuel. Sascha Deri, who invented the biofuel, is cagey about what it's made of, but says it can be sourced from farms around the world. The founder and chief executive of bluShift Aerospace, he and his team have spent more than six years refining the formula and designing a modular hybrid engine, which is also unique. ""We want to prove that a bio-derived fuel can serve just as well, if not better in some cases, than traditional fuels to power rockets and payloads to space,"" he says. ""It actually costs less per kilogram than traditional rocket fuel and it's completely non-toxic. And it's a carbon-neutral fuel which is inherently better for our planet and more responsible."" It is the first commercial launch of a rocket powered by bio-derived fuel. Stardust is a small rocket, just 20ft (6m) long and weighing 550lbs (250kg). But because it's relatively cheap to fly and doesn't need the high-tech infrastructure of larger rockets, it will help make space research accessible to more people. Students, researchers and businesses will be able to conduct experiments and test products with greater control and frequency. ""Right now there are freight trains to space like SpaceX and ULA - and there are buses to space, like medium size rockets,"" says Deri. ""They're taking thousands of kilograms to space. But there's no space launch service allowing one or two payloads to go to space. There's no Uber to space. We want to be the Uber service to space."" For the first launch, the payload included a high school experiment and tests on an alloy called nitinol made by Kellogg Research Labs in Salem, New Hampshire. Founder Joe Kellogg says nitinol is a shape memory material that is used in medical devices such as stents. It is also used to protect rocket payloads from vibrations. ""We're very heavily involved in space and trying to get into the larger missions like the lunar missions and the Mars missions that are coming up. Our long-term goal is to build whole rockets out of nitinol,"" he says. ""We think we can make them lighter and more energy efficient."" A second planned rocket will be suborbital and a later version called Red Dwarf will enter polar orbit While Stardust flew just one mile into the sky before parachuting back to Earth, a second planned rocket will be suborbital and a later version called Red Dwarf will enter polar orbit. Polar orbits offer more exposure to land than equatorial orbits. And Maine is geographically suited to such launches which makes it attractive to the growing space satellite communication industry, says Terry Shehata, executive director of Maine Space Grant Consortium which is funded by the US space agency Nasa. By some estimates, small satellite launch services could generate $69bn (£50bn) within the next decade. bluShift alone expects to create 40 new jobs in five years through launching tiny satellites known as cubesats. Maine already has the infrastructure to support the industry, says Shehata. At the height of the Cold War, Loring Air Force Base at Limestone was the nation's front line of defence. B-52 bombers armed with nuclear warheads constantly circled the skies on high alert to deter any threat from Russia. Stardust launched from the base's three-mile runway of reinforced concrete and was temporarily housed in a hangar built for fighter jets. The base closed in 1994, with devastating economic effects on the region. Other former bases include Brunswick Landing which could become Mission Control for a statewide spaceport complex. ""Maine has the right resources, we have the people, we have the geographical advantage of being able to launch into polar orbit. All we need to do is believe in ourselves that we can do this,"" says Deri.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber: London cabbies plan to sue for damages,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55742569,,"Thousands of London taxi drivers plan to sue Uber for damages alleging the ride-hailing firm operated unlawfully. The planned group legal action could, if successful, hit Uber with a bill for millions of pounds. The action, part of a planned anti-Uber campaign by black-cab drivers this year, claims it didn't follow private hire rules between 2012 and 2018. Uber said it ""operates lawfully in London and these allegations are completely unfounded"". The group action, which will be launched by law firm Mishcon de Reya, will allege that for six years Uber operated unlawfully in London. Taxi rules in London mean that people have to contact a centralised office for minicabs, whereas they can hail a black cab on the street. The lawsuit will claim that between 2012 and 2018, Uber let people hail its drivers directly, contravening those rules. Uber spared from London ban despite 'historical failings' Litigation specialist RGL Management, which is also working with the cabbies to bring the case, said more than 4,000 had signed up so far. There are about 5,200 further registrations being processed, with hundreds of enquiries per day, it said. The firm is funding a marketing campaign, and is looking to sign up as many as 30,000 eligible drivers. A full-time driver over those six years could claim about £25,000 in lost earnings, it added. The group action is aiming to bring a case to the High Court no later than the first quarter of 2022. This is not the first time that London's black cabs have done battle with Uber, but today's announcement shows neither side have conceded defeat. The proposed claim itself is huge - loss of earnings for up to 30,000 drivers for nearly 6 years -  and comes at a time when London black cabs and private hire vehicle drivers are struggling for work after nearly a year of lockdowns and restrictions. Uber might now have its licence back, but the black cabs aren't willing to give them an easy ride. An Uber spokeswoman said: ""Uber operates lawfully in London and these allegations are completely unfounded. ""We are proud to serve this great global city and the 45,000 drivers in London who rely on the app for earnings opportunities, and are committed to helping people move safely."" Uber has had a torrid history in the UK capital including previous lawsuits. In February 2019 cab driverslost a legal challengewhich argued that Uber's London operating licence was granted by a biased judge. Uber then went on tolose its licence to operate in Londonin November 2019 after safety concerns.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber fined over withholding sexual assault records,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55332511,,"Uber has been fined $59m (£43m) for refusing to hand over the details of more than 1,200 alleged victims of sexual assault involving its drivers. The taxi app firm said providing the information would be a ""shocking violation of privacy"" for victims. Its decision was supported by one victims' rights group. The California Public Utility Commission (CPUC), which imposed the fine, said it did not require a public disclosure of the information. The assaults allegedly took place in California between 2017 and 2019. Uber had argued that public disclosure may be traumatic for survivors, potentially putting them in danger and discouraging others from coming forward. But it also stated, in a long-running case with the CPUC, that it might not have a complete account of the incidents. In its most recent ruling the CPUC said it ""requires only that the information regarding sexual assault and sexual harassment be submitted to the Commission under seal"", which would have kept the details of individual cases private. It added: ""Uber's effort to frustrate Commission oversight of the particulars of sexual assault and sexual harassment claims is also troubling given Uber's professed desire to provide the safest transportation services."" RAINN (Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network) had, in an August filing on the case, defended Uber, saying the firm should not have to share victims' names without their consent. According to the RAINN website, it is involved in a partnership with Uber to provide tips for ""the best ways to respect others while driving and riding"". Some pointed out that Uber had in the past shown little regard for user privacy.In November 2017it concealed a huge data breach that affected 57 million customers and drivers. And in 2016it was revealed that an internal company tool called God View allowed employees to see the location of Uber vehicles and customers who had requested a car. As a result of that, Uber was ordered by the Federal Trade Commission to bring in stricter controls, and agree to be assessed by an independent auditor every two years.

Elevate is the second business Uber has sold off this week as the company seeks a path to profitability. On Monday, Uber announced the sale of its self-driving unit to autonomous vehicle start-up Aurora. Joby and Uber, however, described the latest transaction as an ""expanded partnership"".

Uber sells self-driving cars to focus on profits Is the airborne commute a flight of fancy? Under the deal, Uber will also invest and additional $75m (£56m) in Joby Aviation. Elevate began in 2016 and, until earlier this year, its team had promised the launch of flying taxi services in Los Angeles, Dallas and Melbourne in 2023. Joby was a partner in Elevate before taking over the business, and the two companies said they would each integrate the other company's services into their own app. ""These tools and new team members will be invaluable to us as we accelerate our plans for commercial launch,"" said Joby founder JoeBen Bevirt in a statement.

It will have a range of up to 241km and a top speed of 321kmh, the company said. The company is currently still testing the aircraft. The latest move comes as Uber tries to cut costs in an effort to become profitable. Although Uber had promised investors that it will achieve profitability by the end of 2021, the company still reported a $625m loss last quarter. Uber was initially hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, with rides - its main source of income - plummeting by about 80% in April, before rebounding. In order to reach profitability, the company has vowed to focus on its core ride-hailing and food delivery platforms, while cutting costs. In May, the company said it would slash thousands of jobs, while closing or consolidating more than 40 offices. In addition to selling off Elevate, Uber also sold off its driverless car subsidiary to Aurora Technologies on Monday, while taking a 26% stake in the driverless start-up. Driverless technologies were once seen as a key priority for Uber, but the program has faced numerous setbacks. One of its cars was involved in a deadly crash in Arizona, though officials blamed human error for the accident and declined to bring criminal charges against the company.

Fiona Bevan, who has written songs for One Direction, Steps and Lewis Capaldi, said many writers were struggling because of the way streaming services pay royalties. Bevan revealed she had earned just £100 for co-writing a track on Kylie Minogue's number one album, Disco. ""The most successful songwriters in the world can't pay their rent,"" she added. ""Right now, hit songwriters are driving Ubers. It's quite shameful."" Bevan was giving evidence to a digital, culture, media and sport select committee inquiry into the economics of streaming, which now accounts for more than three-quarters of music industry income in the UK. MPs heard from musicians including Chic's Nile Rodgers and saxophonist Soweto Kinch, as well as music managers Maria Forte and Kwame Kwaten. Rodgers said he hadn't looked into his streaming income before the Covid-19 pandemic ""because my tour revenue has been so substantial that I could support my entire organisation"". After looking into the figures this year, he was ""completely shocked"". Streaming 'is threatening the future of music' Music royalties smash records amid stark warnings MPs to investigate how artists are paid for streams ""We don't even know what a stream is worth,"" said the musician, adding that ""there's no way you can find out,"" because of non-disclosure agreements between record labels and the streaming services. ""We must have transparency,"" he told the committee. Nile Rodgers spoke to MPs surrounded by gold and platinum discs for his records with Diana Ross, The B-52s and others The guitarist and producer said record labels retain up to 82% of the royalties they receive from streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music, calling the system ""just ridiculous"". And he accused the major labels of deliberately withholding money from artists. ""I look at the record labels as my partners. And the interesting thing is that every single time I've audited my partners, I find money. Every single time. ""And sometimes, it's staggering, the amount of money."" Rodgers, whose credits include Chic's Le Freak, Madonna's Like A Virgin and David Bowie's Let's Dance, said the industry needed to change the way streaming payments are calculated. Currently, each play of a song is counted as a sale, which gives labels the lions' share of the income, he said. But Rodgers went on to argue that a stream was more like a radio broadcast, or a licence of the original recording, which would give artists about 50% of the royalties. ""Labels have unilaterally decided that a stream is considered a sale because it maximises their profits,"" he said. ""Artists and songwriters need to update clauses in their contracts to reflect the true nature of how their songs are being consumed - which is via a licence. It is something that people are borrowing from [the streaming services]"". However, Rodgers was optimistic that labels, streaming services, writers and musicians could negotiate a fairer deal; and asked MPs to make the UK a ""leader"" in regulating the streaming market. ""This can now be a great paradigm shift for songwriters and artists all over the world,"" he said. Mercury-nominated jazz musician Soweto Kinch said the timing of the inquiry was particularly important after Covid-19 had ""eviscerated"" the live music scene. He said streaming had placed a particular strain on niche musical genres and experimental musicians, because of an overriding focus on chart music. ""We'd never have a Kate Bush or a David Bowie in today's music ecology, because it's very risk averse,"" he said. ""You are making songs for playlists, you are not taking the incredible musical risks that Bowie might have taken years ago."" Nadine Shah said she had considered giving up music because earning a living was so difficult The inquiry continues into 2021, and will hear the ""perspectives of industry experts, artists and record labels as well as streaming platforms themselves"". At the first session last month, musician Nadine Shah told MPs ""many fellow musicians"" were afraid to give evidence ""because we do not want to lose favour with the streaming platforms and the major labels"". In response, committee chair Julian Knight MP later warned companies against interfering with the inquiry. ""We have been told by many different sources that some of the people interested in speaking to us have become reluctant to do so because they fear action may be taken against them if they speak in public,"" Knight said. ""I would like to say that we would take a very dim view if we had any evidence of anyone interfering with witnesses to one of our inquiries. No one should suffer any detriment for speaking to a parliamentary committee and anyone deliberately causing harm to one of our witnesses would be in danger of being in contempt of this House.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber sells self-driving cars to focus on profits,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55224462,,"Uber's self-driving car programme met with setbacks after a deadly crash in Arizona in 2018 Uber is selling its driverless car subsidiary to start-up Aurora Technologies, abandoning a unit that Uber's founder once hailed as critical to the future of the firm. Aurora, founded in 2017,said the deal,externalwill help it ""accelerate"" its mission to make self-driving cars a reality. Uber will invest $400m in the Amazon-backed company, giving it a 26% stake. Its chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi will also serve on Aurora's board, following closure of the deal. Despite the sale of its driverless car subsidiary known as Advanced Technologies Group, Uber said it remained interested in the sector, with plans to collaborate with Aurora when it comes to launching driverless cars on its network. ""Few technologies hold as much promise to improve people's lives with safe, accessible, and environmentally friendly transportation as self-driving vehicles,"" Mr Khosrowshahi said. ""For the last five years, our phenomenal team ... has been at the forefront of this effort - and in joining forces with Aurora, they are now in pole position to deliver on that promise even faster."" Developing driverless technology was a key priority when Uber's founder and former chief executive Travis Kalanick was leading the ride hailing firm, since he saw it as a way to reduce costs. But the programme hit setbacksafter one of its cars was involved in a deadly crash in Arizona, though officials blamed human error for the accident and declined to bring criminal charges against the company. The driverless car unit was also tangled up in legal fights overallegations of technology theft. Mr Khosrowshahi, who replaced Mr Kalanick as the boss of Uber in 2017, has refocused the firm on taxi and food delivery services as he pushes to make Uber profitable. The deal with Aurora values Uber's Advanced Technologies Group at roughly $4bn, down from the $7.5bn it was estimated to be worth last year, according to Reuters. It is expected to be completed in the first three months of 2021,Uber said,external. Aurora, led by veterans of driverless car efforts at Google and Uber, says it has previously received ""significant investment"" from Amazon, which is known to be exploring the possibility of driverless delivery vehicles.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber sees 'fundamental shift' in food delivery demand,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54834809,,"Uber's food delivery business is booming Uber's food delivery business has more than doubled, as the pandemic increases appetite for online grocery orders and restaurant takeaway. The firm said revenue from its Uber Eats service hit $1.4bn (£1bn) in the three months to 30 September, jumping 124% from the same period in 2019. The growth helped offset steep declines in the firm's core rides business. But Uber still recorded a loss of about $1.1bn in the quarter, roughly the same as last year. Uber boss Dara Khosrowshahi said demand for food delivery has stayed strong even as countries lift restrictions, a promising sign for growth in the Uber Eats business. ""We've got more eaters, they're staying longer, they're eating more,"" he told investors on a conference call to discuss the firm's quarterly results. ""There's no question in my mind that ... there's a fundamental behavioural shift that has gone on,"" he added later. ""People aren't going to stop using Amazon. People aren't going to stop using Eats."" The growth in delivery marked a stark contrast to the firm's ride-hailing business. There, Uber said bookings and revenue for its taxi service remained roughly half of last year's levels, despite improvement since the spring. Demand has recovered most in Europe, while lagging in the US and Canada, its most important market, executives said. They warned that the resurgence in Covid cases in Europe and new restrictions in countries like the UK and France would likely hit demand in coming months.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber and Lyft win battle over driver status in California,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54809225,,"Some workers opposed Proposition 22, saying it would rob them of rights Voters in California have passed a measure that will see freelance workers continue to be classified as independent contractors, in a victory for companies such as Uber and Lyft. It overturns a landmark labour law passed last year that ruled gig-economy workers should have employee status and the protections that go with it. The new measure, Proposition 22, was backed by Uber, Lyft and DoorDash. The two ride-hailing firms' shares soared in early Wednesday trade. Uber's stock was trading 15% up on its opening price by mid-morning in New York. while Lyft had gained 13%. Their campaign had cost $205m (£157m), making it the most expensive in state history. Some drivers had backed Proposition 22 - but labour groups opposed it, pointing out all the benefits of being classed as employees, including rights to: the minimum wage overtime expenses paid sick days and leave healthcare unemployment insurance And the California Labour Federation had accused supporters of Prop 22, as it was colloquially known, of ""attempting to buy their own law through the ballot measure process"". Labour groups raised about $20m to oppose Prop 22 - but the far wealthier pro-campaign from Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart, was able to buy TV advertising, as as well as putting ads in their taxi-hailing apps. And both Uber and Lyft had threatened to withdraw services from California entirely or severely cut back on drivers if they had to start treating workers as employees. Declaring the success of the vote, which formed part of the wider presidential election, Uber said: ""Today, California voters agreed that instead of eliminating independent work, we should make it better."" The win came with some concessions though and companies must now offer workers: a minimum earning standard of 120% of minimum wage healthcare and accident insurance Other tech-related votes passed overnight included: Maine voters passed a ballot to ban the use of facial recognition by police and city agencies Massachusetts voted in laws guaranteeing people could repair their own property, including by unlocking advanced telematic data in cars so third parties or owners could carry out vehicle maintenance Uber spared from London ban despite 'past failings' Uber sued by drivers over ‘automated robo-firing'..."
BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber sued by drivers over ‘automated robo-firing',https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54698858,,"Former Uber drivers have accused the taxi app firm of using automated ""robo-firing"" algorithms to dismiss them. British drivers want courts in the Netherlands - where Uber's data is based - to overrule the algorithm that they say caused them to be fired. Experts say the legal challenge is the first of its kind to test the protections of GDPR Article 22. Uber told the BBC that drivers' accounts were only deactivated following manual review by humans. ""Uber provides requested personal data and information that individuals are entitled to,"" said a spokeswoman for Uber. ""We will give explanations when we cannot provide certain data, such as when it doesn't exist or disclosing it would infringe on the rights of another person under GDPR."" The European Union's (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in 2018, imposes obligations on companies who collect people's personal information, no matter where they are located in the world, if that data is related to EU consumers. ""As part of our regular processes, the drivers in this case were only deactivated after manual reviews by our specialist team,"" the spokeswoman added. The algorithms that make big decisions about your life Uber spared from London ban despite 'historical failings' The man who taught Uber how to say sorry The App Drivers & Couriers Union (ADCU), which is bringing the legal challenge, says that since 2018, it has seen well over 1,000 individual cases where drivers have allegedly been wrongly accused of fraudulent activity and immediately had their accounts terminated without a right of appeal. ""For any private hire operator in London, if they fire someone, there is a requirement where they have to report the driver to Transport for London (TfL),"" James Farrar, the ADCU's general secretary told the BBC. ""This is putting drivers in a Kafkaesque situation where they may be called in by TfL, they're given 14 days to explain the situation and why they should keep their licence. Our drivers are in a terrible position because they don't know what the issue is, Uber hasn't told them."" Mr Farrar further claims that when TfL asked for additional details, Uber told TfL that it could not provide them, because it would compromise Uber's security. ADCU adds that none of the drivers represented by it in this lawsuit have been reported to the police by Uber after having their accounts terminated. A former Uber driver with ADCU, who has asked not to be named, told the BBC that he had been driving with Uber for about two years and had a customer rating of 4.94 when he was suddenly terminated from the app. ""The day it happened, I went to work and on my app, it said I wasn't allowed to log in. The app said to call customer support,"" he said. ""I rang customer support and I was told that my account was deactivated because I had been engaging in fraudulent activities."" He said that he contacted Uber more than 50 times over a year and a half via the phone and email, but claims he was never told what he had done that was ""fraudulent"". When he called customer support, he was told that a ""specialised team"" was dealing with the issue, and that they would call him back. They never called, he says. ""I was pleading with them in my emails repeatedly. I even asked if I could have a face-to-face meeting with the specialised team. I was willing to travel to another country to meet them,"" he said. ""I have a family to feed. I'm not a fraudster or a criminal."" After being terminated, the driver was reported to TfL by Uber. But the taxi app firm did not report him to the police. TfL wrote to the driver to ask him to answer the allegations in writing. When the driver explained, TfL dropped the matter and did not revoke his licence. Anton Ekker is a privacy lawyer based in Amsterdam who is representing the British former Uber drivers. ""We know for sure that Uber is using algorithms for decisions about fraud and deactivation of drivers. This is happening everywhere,"" he said. Privacy lawyer Anton Ekker is representing British former Uber drivers in the Dutch courts On Uber's claims that its termination decisions are made by humans, Mr Ekker said: ""If it is automated decision-making, then the GDPR says they must have legal grounds to use such technology, and they must give drivers the possibility to object to an automated decision, which they clearly did not do."" Mr Ekker added that on Twitter he had seen thousands of complaints from Uber drivers all over the world, saying they had been automatically terminated for committing fraud without an explanation. His intention is to seek a ruling from the Dutch courts, which, if successful, would then make it possible to bring a class action lawsuit against Uber. According to Prof Lilian Edwards, chair of Law, Innovation and Society at Newcastle University, ADCU's legal challenge could set a precedent with the European Court of Justice. ""This is probably the biggest case we've had so far on Article 22 of the GDPR that's ever gotten to the courts,"" she told the BBC. In 2017, Prof Edwards, together with Dr Michael Veale of University College London,published an academic paper,externalexploring the challenges relating to transparency and fairness when it comes to the use of computer algorithms to make decisions that affect people's lives. ""Article 22 is really important because this is the provision that arguably gives you the right to an explanation about why an automated decision was made about you,"" she explained. ""There's been huge debate for years about whether the law could give people some rights over it, and this is a way for us to get some control over it and to be able to challenge it if it's wrong. ""So this is really big news,"" she says. The man who taught Uber how to say sorry Uber spared from London ban despite 'past failings' The algorithms that make decisions about your life..."
BBC,0.05855610077732243,The man who taught Uber how to say sorry,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-54613947,,"When the Uber he'd hired went to the wrong destination, one professor took his complaint to the very top - and then learned something valuable about the science of apologising. In January 2017, John List was due to give a keynote speech at a prestigious gathering of economists. He picked up his phone and, using the Uber app, booked a cab to take him the 30-minute journey from his home. He looked up briefly, as the car sped along Lake Shore Drive, on the banks of Lake Michigan, and took in the view of the approaching city, with its fabulous skyline of skyscrapers. Then he settled back down to work on his talk. About 20 minutes later he looked up again. Surely he must be nearly there now? ""Oh no!!"" he screamed. He was back where he'd begun. Something had gone wrong with the Uber app, which had instructed the driver to return to the professor's home. She had not wanted to disturb him, as he was so engrossed in his work. List was understandably furious. But what made him more so, was that Uber never sent him an apology. Not everyone who has a complaint to make with Uber has access to its chief executive, but John List did, and so he rang Travis Kalanick that evening. (This was not long before Kalanick was forced to step down as a result of shareholder pressure, following a series of controversies over company practices including its handling of sexual harassment allegations.) After List had related the tale, and let off a bit of steam, Kalanick spoke. ""What I want to know,"" he said, ""is how Uber should apologise when this sort of cock-up occurs.  What's the best way to keep Uber customers loyal, even when they've had a miserable experience?"" How to apologise is a question which every company is interested to know the answer. And John List was in a unique position to find out. Not many people with John List's background become leading academics. He grew up in a working class family in Sun Prairie, north-east of the Wisconsin capital Madison. His Dad was a lorry driver and expected his son to enter the family business. John had other ideas. His dream was to become a professional golfer and he won a golf scholarship to college. There he discovered two things: first, he wasn't as good at golf as he had once thought, and second, he was fascinated by economics. He's now on the economics faculty at one of America's top universities, the University of Chicago. But for a few years he's also been moonlighting, because Uber approached him to be their chief economist, and after he moved on from Uber, he joined another car-riding app, Lyft, where he holds the same position. Travis Kalanick had to make a series of apologies himself, before resigning in 2017 No doubt the job is generously remunerated, but for John List it has another appeal; for data geeks, car apps are like gold mines - in the US alone, before the pandemic, there were two million Uber drivers, making tens of millions of trips each week. John List has spent his career studying economic behaviour in the real world, so working with Uber ""was a dream come true"". With this cornucopia of information, he could analyse all sorts of consumer preferences: what kinds of cars people like, how far they typically travelled, and at what times, how they responded to a change in the price of fares. He could also learn the best way to apologise. His first step was to look at what happened to Uber users after they had had a bad ride - one that had taken much longer than the app had initially predicted. The app might predict, for example, that a journey would take nine minutes, and it would end up taking 23 minutes. By crunching the numbers, he and his collaborators discovered that riders who'd experienced such a bad ride would spend up to 10% less on Uber in the future. That represented a significant loss of earnings for the car app. The next move was to come up with a variety of apologies, and to randomly try them out on those who'd experienced a bad trip. Listen to John List inUbernomics,an episode of The Big Idea, on the BBC World Service Click here for transmission times, or to listen online Download the podcast It turns out there's a sort of science of sorry. Social scientists - and psychologists in particular - have studied what kinds of apologies work. But John List had a big advantage; he could actually measure the impact. He calls one type of sorry, the ""basic apology"" - ""We note that your trip took longer than we predicted and we sincerely apologise."" A more sophisticated apology involves an admission that the company messed up. Another type of apology involves a commitment - ""We will try to ensure that this will not happen again."" On Uber's behalf, John List tried them all. What's more, with some of these apologies Uber offered a $5 discount off the next trip. In the experiment there was also a group of Uber customers who received no apology at all. How many people does it take to oust a political leader? Choice blindness: Do you know yourself as well as you think? The result was surprising. On their own, apologies in whatever form proved ineffective. But an apology coupled with the $5 coupon kept many people loyal. ""So, we end up bringing back millions of dollars by assuaging consumers with an apology and a coupon."" What consumers want, it turns out, is for a company to demonstrate its remorse by taking a material financial hit. But looking deeper into the stats, List realised that even this device ceased to work if there was a second or third bad trip. Indeed, a second or third apology only seemed to alienate customers further. These are invaluable insights for Uber, and for other businesses too. Many economists sit at their desks and make predictions about economic activity based on their models. What makes John List a little unusual for an economist is that he likes to test theories out in the real world. He's conducted experiments from Tanzania, to New Zealand, China to Bangladesh. The vast digital data sets held by Uber and other car apps have enabled him to identify certain quirks in human behaviour that armchair economists might not have uncovered. For example, when you book an Uber you never know whether you'll get a male or female driver, so you might expect male and female drivers to earn the same. But in fact, male drivers earn about 7% more per hour than their female counterparts. Shocked by this disparity, List set about trying to find out the reason for it. He uncovered several explanations. One is that women tend to have more childcare responsibilities, so there are fewer female drivers available at lucrative times, such as morning and afternoon rush hour. But by far the most important factor turns out to be speed: Uber-driving men drive on average about 2.5% faster than Uber-driving women, so they give more rides per hour. Male drivers get smaller tips (even when they're awake) That's not the only gender gap. Because he thought it would make Uber drivers happier, List persuaded the Uber board to add a tipping function - bringing Uber in line with other car apps. He then studied tipping behaviour. For every $4 women give as a tip, it transpired, men give around $5. What's more, women drivers receive more tips than male drivers - except when those women drivers are 65 years old or older. I think we can take this as further evidence of male shallowness. The study of economic behaviour through car app data has been called Ubernomics - though John List's box of data toys is now delivered to him by Lyft, not Uber - and he continues to produce a stream of fascinating results. Analysing the behaviour of Lyft users, he's recently computed the power of what he calls ""left-digit bias"". Cutting the price of a journey from $15 to $14.99 has roughly the same impact on consumer demand as reducing it from $15.99 to $15. Some of the discoveries in Ubernomics are unsurprising. Consumers care about price: the lower the cost, the more likely we are to book a cab. But the analysis of how we use car apps is also revealing some of the biases and idiosyncrasies of human economic behaviour. By the way, if you ever decide to become an Uber driver, and think that being nice to the customer will have a significant impact on your income, there is some bad news. I'm afraid it won't. Even when customers rate one driver 10% higher than another for niceness, John List says, they both receive the same tip. We are not used to the idea of machines making ethical decisions, but the day when they will routinely do this - by themselves - is fast approaching. So how, asks the BBC's David Edmonds, will we teach them to do the right thing? Can we teach robots ethics?..."

The cab company has been operating in London since February. TfL said the firm reported a number of failings including more than 1,000 trips made by unlicensed drivers. Ola said it will appeal the decision and has 21 days to do so. It can operate in the meantime, according to the appeal rules. The transport authority said Ola did not report the failings as soon as it knew about them. ""Through our investigations we discovered that flaws in Ola's operating model have led to the use of unlicensed drivers and vehicles in more than 1,000 passenger trips, which may have put passenger safety at risk,"" Helen Chapman, TfL's director of licensing, regulation and charging, said. ""If they do appeal, Ola can continue to operate and drivers can continue to undertake bookings on behalf of Ola. We will closely scrutinise the company to ensure passengers safety is not compromised."" The ride-hailing company began operating in Cardiff in 2018 and has since spread to other UK locations. ""We have been working with TfL during the review period and have sought to provide assurances and address the issues raised in an open and transparent manner,"" Marc Rozendal, Ola's UK Managing Director, said in a statement. ""Ola will take the opportunity to appeal this decision and in doing so, our riders and drivers can rest assured that we will continue to operate as normal, providing safe and reliable mobility for London."" Last week, major rival Uber secured its right to continue operating in London after a judge upheld its appeal against TfL. The ride-hailing giant has been granted a new licence to work in the capital, nearly a year after TfL rejected its application, also over safety concerns because of unlicensed drivers.

It was inadequate, we could have done better."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said TfL was ""absolutely right"" not to renew Uber licence last year but acknowledged the company had ""made improvements"". However, he added: ""I can assure Londoners that TfL will continue to closely monitor Uber and will not hesitate to take swift action should they fail to meet the strict standards required to protect passengers."" Deputy chief magistrate Tan Ikram said he took Uber's ""track-record of regulation breaches"" into account but said it had made efforts to address failings and had improved standards. ""Despite their historical failings, I find them, now, to be a fit and proper person to hold a London PHV [private hire vehicle] operator's licence,"" he said. The judge said Uber ""does not have a perfect record but it has been an improving picture"". ""The test as to whether [Uber] are a 'fit and proper person' does not require perfection. I am satisfied that they are doing what a reasonable business in their sector could be expected to do, perhaps even more."" The new licence will run for 18 months and comes with a number of conditions, allowing TfL to closely monitor Uber's adherence to the regulations. Uber's Mr Heywood said: ""This decision is a recognition of Uber's commitment to safety and we will continue to work constructively with TfL."" With 45,000 drivers on its books in London, Uber is a force to be reckoned with. But the body in charge of licensing in London has gone out of its way to take Uber on. Transport for London (TfL) did manage to draw attention to a previous flaw in Uber's system which allowed unauthorised drivers to ferry people around. TfL piled on the pressure and, according to a judge, Uber's safety record has improved. But when it refused to renew Uber's license, TfL knew that a judge would have the ultimate call. And at no point did anyone have to tell Uber's users in London that they couldn't order a cab. Talking tough on Uber is one thing. But banishing it from a key European capital would carry significant consequences. TfL originally refused to renew Uber's licence in September 2017. The company then won a 15-month licence by a judge in June 2018 after taking the case to court. Uber was granted a two-month extension to its licence in September last year, but in NovemberTfL decided not to grant it a new licence,external. At the time, TfL said it had ""identified a pattern of failures by the company including several breaches that placed passengers and their safety at risk"". Uber appealed against the decision and was allowed to keep operating throughout the process. Business campaign group London First said Monday's decision was ""good news for millions of Londoners and visitors who rely on Uber to get around the capital"". However, the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association said it was a ""disaster for London"". ""Uber has demonstrated time and time again that it simply can't be trusted to put the safety of Londoners, its drivers and other road users above profit,"" it said. ""Sadly, it seems that Uber is too big to regulate effectively but too big to fail."" Uber is still awaitinga separate UK court rulingover whether its drivers should be classed as workers or self-employed. The case, brought by two former drivers, could see Uber forced to compensate drivers across the UK for missed holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the national minimum wage. Uber, however, says the ""vast majority"" of its drivers like being freelance. The courts ruled in favour of the drivers in 2016 and Uber lost an appeal in 2018. A judgement on the firm's final appeal to the Supreme Court is expected soon. Coronavirus: Uber customer activity falls sharply Uber loses licence to operate in London..."
BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber's self-driving operator charged over fatal crash,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54175359,,"The self-driving Volvo hit a pedestrian at 39mph, despite the presence of a safety driver The back-up driver of an Uber self-driving car that killed a pedestrian has been charged with negligent homicide. Elaine Herzberg, aged 49, was hit by the car as she wheeled a bicycle across the road in Tempe, Arizona, in 2018. Investigators said the car's safety driver, Rafael Vasquez, had been streaming an episode of the television show The Voice at the time. Ms Vasquez pleaded not guilty, and was released to await trial. Uber will not face criminal charges, aftera decision last year that there was ""no basis for criminal liability""for the corporation. The accident was the first death on record involving a self-driving car, and resulted in Uber ending its testing of the technology in Arizona. Lengthy investigations by police and the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that human error was mostly to blame for the crash. Ms Vasquez was in the driver's seat, and had the ability to take over control of the vehicle in an emergency. Dash-cam footage released by police showed Ms Vasquez looking down, away from the road, for several seconds immediately before the crash, while the car was travelling at 39mph (63km/h). Police say that although her first name was listed on her driver's licence as Rafael, Ms Vasquez identifies as a woman and goes by Rafaela. This video can not be played Uber dash-cam footage shows moment before fatal impact Records from the streaming service Hulu also seemed to show that her device had been streaming a television show at the time. A police report from June 2018 labelled the fatal collision as ""entirely avoidable""if the driver had been watching the road. The NTSB, meanwhile, identified the probable cause of the accident as failure of the operator to monitor their surroundings, and the automated system, ""because she was visually distracted throughout the trip by her personal cell phone"". Self-driving Uber in fatal crash had 'safety flaws' Uber warned about self-drive car crashes NTSB vice chairman Bruce Landsberg wrote in the report: ""On this trip, the safety driver spent 34% of the time looking at her cell phone while streaming a TV show."" Ms Vasquez was charged on 27 August, and made her first appearance in court on 15 September. The trial is now set for February next year. In May 2018, when Elaine Herzberg was killed, confidence in autonomous vehicle technology was at an all-time high. Everyone from Elon Musk to the British Chancellor Philip Hammond was telling us that robo-taxis and other autonomous vehicles would be on the roads within a couple of years, cutting congestion and delivering a big boost to road safety. But the accident in Arizona punctured that confidence. It showed that however smart the machine learning in the autonomous systems, mixing robots with humans as cars made the journey towards full autonomy was going to prove a real challenge. Not only did Uber have to halt its testing programme for a while, but rivals such as Google's Waymo became notably more cautious in their trials. Only today it is being reported that the Chinese tech giant Baidu is pushing back the full rollout of its robo-taxis until 2025, partly because of confusion about regulations. As long as ""self-driving"" cars still need a human safety driver behind the wheel, there will be confusion about whose fault it is when something goes wrong - but going fully autonomous is such a huge leap that even the boldest tech firm is likely to be very cautious about going first. Despite the decision not to levy criminal charges against Uber itself, the company did not escape criticism. The NTSB report said that Uber's ""inadequate safety risk assessment procedures"" and ""ineffective oversight of vehicle operators"" were contributing factors. It accused the company of having an ""inadequate safety culture"". The vehicle's automatic systemsfailed to identify Ms Herzberg and her bicycle as an imminent collision dangerin the way they were supposed to, the NTSB found. Days before the crash,an employee had warned his superiors that the vehicles were unsafe, were routinely in accidents, and raised concerns about the training of operators. Following the crash, authorities in Arizona suspended Uber's ability to test self-driving cars on the state's public roads, and Uber ended its tests in the state. It received permission tocarry out tests in the state of California earlier this year.

Uber and smaller rival Lyft have faced ongoing criticism for their role contributing to traffic and air pollution, withresearch,externalshowing many of their rides replace less polluting alternatives, like walking, biking, or taking public transport. Lyft in June pledged to have an all electric fleet by 2030, but it did not outline support for drivers. Many of them operate their own cars. Uber on Tuesday said that battery electric vehicles accounted for roughly 0.15% of the miles logged on its platform in the US and Canada between 2017 and 2019. Including hybrids, the mileage logged in green vehicles is about five times the average in the United States. In London, where it has clashed with regulators, Uber had already pledged that all the firm's rides would happen in electric cars by 2025. EU says one in eight deaths is linked to pollution London Uber fares go up after electric car charge Coronavirus: Uber announces drastic cuts to secure its future Uber and Lyft drivers are employees, says US judge On Tuesday, Uber said it was working with Renault and Nissan to expand that effort to other European cities, starting in France. In the US and Canada, it is working with General Motors. Uber said drivers will earn more per ride if they are using electric or hybrid cars and it was also working to include more alternatives to cars in its app. Climate change organisations, which have pressed the company to improve its environmental record, said they were pleased by Uber's announcement. ""Uber's commitment to rapidly electrify its fleet in major European cities is good news,"" said William Todts, executive director of the campaign group Transport & Environment. ""Now it's time for Europe's city mayors to show leadership.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Want an Uber? Send a selfie proving you are wearing a mask,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53992253,,"Uber is to roll out a selfie feature on its app so that drivers can verify some riders are wearing face masks. It will apply to riders who have previously been reported for not wearing a mask. The selfie scanner, to be used in the US and Canada by the end of September and other regions after that, will look for a mask-like covering over the mouth and nose. Currently, drivers must take a mask selfie each day before starting work. If the scanner does not detect the driver is wearing a mask they are blocked from using the app to pick up passengers. Uber introduced a ""No Mask No Ride"" policy on 18 May and extended it indefinitely due to the ongoing pandemic, requiring both drivers and riders to wear a face covering at all times during a ride. Drivers and riders are able to cancel a trip without charge if they report the other party is not wearing a mask. Failure to comply can lead to account deactivation. Demand for ride-hailing trips fell sharply during the coronavirus lockdown, especially in the US. In a tweet, Uber boss Dara Khosrowshahi said the move was to help protect drivers and passengers. ""We're all in this together,"" he said. Uber said it hoped the feature would be a useful reminder of its policy for customers who are just returning to the service. ""We definitely wanted to make sure that we are targeting this feature to riders who are maybe just coming back to the platform and maybe they're not aware of our mask policy,"" said Sachin Kansal, Uber's senior director of product management. Uber said the selfie feature does not use facial recognition technology, but simply detects the mask as an object on the face. The company said it will store the selfie photos for 96 hours to settle potential disputes, but then permanently deletes them, Uber said. Uber says it has allocated $50m (£37m) worth of masks, gloves, hand sanitiser, sprays and wipes to drivers. The company said it has distributed masks to 1.4 million drivers globally.

The 52-year-old is accused of trying to cover up adata breach in 2016that exposed the details of 57 million Uber drivers and passengers. The company has previously admitted to paying a group of hackers a $100,000 (£75,000) ransom to delete the data they had stolen. Mr Sullivan was fired in 2017 when the data breach was revealed. Thecharges filed by the US Department of Justice,externalsaid Mr Sullivan had taken ""deliberate steps"" to stop the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) from finding out about the hack. He is accused of approving the $100,000 payment to the hackers, which was made in bitcoin. The payment was disguised as a ""bug bounty"" reward, used to pay cyber-security researchers who disclose vulnerabilities so they can be fixed. The charges allege that he asked the hackers to sign non-disclosure agreements, falsely stating they had not stolen any Uber data. ""Silicon Valley is not the Wild West,"" said US lawyer David Anderson. ""We expect good corporate citizenship. We expect prompt reporting of criminal conduct. We expect co-operation with our investigations. We will not tolerate corporate cover-ups."" A spokesman for Mr Sullivan said he denied the charges. ""If not for Mr Sullivan's and his team's efforts, it's likely that the individuals responsible for this incident never would have been identified at all,"" said spokesman Brad Williams. Mr Sullivan currently works as chief information security officer at cyber-security firm Cloudflare. Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi disclosed the data breach in 2017. The company eventually paid $148m to settle legal claims by all 50 US states and Washington DC. By Joe Tidy, Cyber Reporter When is a breach a breach? This could be the key question facing the court in this case which will be watched closely by hackers and security experts around the world. Mr Sullivan says he did nothing wrong and was simply rewarding the hackers a ""bug bounty"" for discovering a security flaw in Uber's system. Many large companies have open bug bounty schemes that invite hackers - under strict conditions - to test their computer systems for flaws. If they find one, they get paid and the company can fix it without needing to alert the authorities. But these hackers did not approach Uber as part of a scheme. They broke into the systems anonymously, stole data and held the company to ransom. Effectively, Mr Sullivan is being accused of turning a serious hack into a routine bug bounty, which was therefore not worth notifying the authorities or his company about. The fact that the hackers themselves have already pleaded guilty to the cyber-attack may not help Mr Sullivan's case. Uber pays $148m over data breach cover-up..."

The ride-hailing firms had threatened to suspend operations over an earlier ruling that they must classify drivers as employees, not contractors. But the reprieve allows them to continue operating while the court considers their case for appeal. The court's decision came just hours before Lyft was due to halt rides. The court has ordered Uber and Lyft to both submit their plans for hiring employees by early September, and oral arguments in the case are set for mid-October. Lyft was due to stop its services in California at 23:59 local time on Thursday (06:59 GMT on Friday). ""This is not something we wanted to do, as we know millions of Californians depend on Lyft for daily, essential trips,"" Lyft had said in a statement posted online. Both firms have always argued their drivers are self-employed contractors. But a California law that came into effect earlier this year, known as AB5, extended employee classification to workers in the ""gig economy"". The judge's ruling that the law applied to both Uber and Lyft meansthe firms need to provide drivers with extra benefits, such as unemployment protection. Both companies filed an appeal to the judgement - and asked for a stay on its enforcement while the courts dealt with the appeal. Unless the stay was granted, both companies had 10 days to undertake what they saw as a significant overhaul of their business in California. They both warned that they could be forced to pull services from the state at the end of the day on Thursday. Lyft claims that four out of five of its drivers do not want to be classified as employees. Both argue that flexibility is valued by those who choose to work for them. The two firms had been emailing customers and sending app push notifications to try to drum up support for their side of the argument. Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, meanwhile, wrotean opinion piece for the New York Times,,externalarguing that his firm was not truly against paying the costs of things like health insurance. Instead, he argued that the choice between being a full-time employee and a ""gig"" worker was a problem itself, and laws needed to be changed. He argued for a system where companies pay benefits based on a rate per hour worked. This video can not be played Two Uber drivers take opposing views on how the company should treat them But he has also said that the company can only offer full jobs to a tiny fraction of its workforce.In a podcast interview with Vox Media, he summed up the problem as,external: ""We can't go out and hire 50,000 people overnight."" Lyft echoed that sentiment, telling the court that it ""cannot make the changes the injunction requires at the flip of a switch"". The companies do have some outside support. Some drivers do not want to be classed as employees,and the mayors of San Diego and San Jose,external- one Democrat and one Republican - joined forces to warn that shutting down the services ""virtually overnight"" would hurt one million residents in the state. There is a potential way out for the ride-sharing firms in the coming months. A ballot that will be put to vote in November, at the same time as the US presidential election, would grant Uber and Lyft an exemption from the law. It is known as proposition 22. ""Your voice can help,"" Lyft wrote in its blog post about suspending services. ""Prop 22, proposes the necessary changes to give drivers benefits and flexibility, while maintaining the rideshare model that helps you get where you need to go,"" it said. Both companies, along with other supporters such as food delivery app DoorDash, are reported to have spent millions of dollars in lobbying and campaigning for the law. Labour groups, meanwhile, are set firmly against it, arguing it will save the companies vast sums of money at the expense of drivers.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Coronavirus: Uber customer activity falls sharply,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53687422,,"Uber's food delivery business is booming The number of customers active on Uber's apps has dropped nearly in half since last year as the pandemic devastates demand for the company's taxi services. The ride-hailing giant said it had an average of 55 million customers each month in the April-June period, down from 99 million last year. The fall came despite a boom in its food delivery business, which saw orders more than double. But trip bookings were down 75%. That is just a slight recovery from the plunge seen at the height of the lockdowns this spring, when the rides business collapsed as much as 80%. Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said the two sides of the business will help the firm navigate the challenges ahead. In the quarter, food delivery brought in more revenue than rides. ""While we would have all hoped that by now we would have a clear line of sight to the end of the pandemic, hope is not a strategy,"" he said. ""The bottom line is we have taken swift action on everything that's within our control."" Uber has been working to offset the collapse of its core taxi business due to the pandemic by increasing its food delivery operations. Last month, it launched a feature that allows users in some cities in the US, Canada, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru to order groceries through its app. The move comes after the firm took a majority stake in Chilean start-up Cornershop last year. It also announced a deal in July to buy US restaurant delivery start-up Postmates for $2.65bn - a move that could give it control of an estimated 30% of the American market. Uber said Uber Eats revenue doubled to $1.2bn in the quarter, as people worried about coronavirus continued to order in rather than eat out. Overall quarterly revenue dropped 29% year-on-year, falling to $2.2bn, as the rides business weighed on results. Revenue Uber collected from trips fell 67% to $790m, while gross bookings - the total dollars from the trips - were down 75% to $3bn. In cities where the virus is under control, demand has bounced back, Mr Khosrowshahi said. ""We haven't seen any signs now that there will be any kind of permanent damage to the business,"" he said. Uber said its losses had narrowed to about $1.8bn, from $5.2bn a year ago, when its listing on the stock exchange swelled costs. The improvement also follows Uber's announcement in May that it was taking steps to slash costs by $1bn including cutting 6,700 jobs - roughly a quarter of its workforce. The figures did not include drivers, which the firm considers independent contractors. That position has drawn multiple lawsuits, including one filed this week by California's Labor Commissioner. Mr Khosrowshahi said he thought the firm had a ""strong path"" to fight those claims or win support among state voters for legislation that would overturn a California law intended to force Uber to change its driver classification.

It said the takeover would let it connect people with mini-cab firms in cities where Uber itself does not have drivers. Autocab's platform has access to more than 75,000 vehicles in areas where Uber does not operate. Uber is currently available in 40 towns and cities in the UK. Autocab initially started out as a radio supply business. It later developed a cloud-based booking platform called iGo that let independent taxi firms offer online bookings. The platform is currently used by about half of the private hire and taxi market in the UK. Following the deal, Uber expects to be available in about 170 towns and cities. That includes Oxford and Doncaster, where Uber says ""tens of thousands"" of people try to use its app every month. Passengers using the Uber app in a UK town where there are no Uber drivers will be able to seamlessly book a private hire car instead. ""Through Autocab's iGo marketplace, Uber will be able to connect these riders with local operators who choose to take their booking,""the company said in a blog post,external. ""In turn, operators should be able to expand their operations and offer more earnings opportunities to local drivers."" Uber said Autocab would ""remain independent"" following the acquisition, and maintain its own board of directors. The companies have not revealed the financial terms of the deal, or explained how Uber will make money from it. Oxford-based mini-cab firm Absolute Cabs told the BBC that it welcomed news of the takeover. ""As a tech-orientated global player, they have brought new ideas and we recognise Uber as a strong player in the industry,"" said press officer Douglas Wallace. ""Private companies like ours will be able to offer the same Uber-style experience but with more local knowledge and investment."" The BBC has contacted the Competition and Markets Authority for comment. It has been a difficult year for Uber, which revealed in April that journeys booked through its app had fallen 80% due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Yaseen Aslam and James Farrar say by classing drivers as contractors, the firm denies them basic rights. But Uber says the ""vast majority"" of its drivers like being freelance. ""This is our final showdown with Uber but the stakes could not be higher,"" says Mr Aslam. Jamie Heywood, Uber's regional general Manager for Northern and Eastern Europe, said: ""Drivers can determine if, when and where they drive, but can also access free AXA insurance to cover sickness or injury, as well as maternity and paternity payments."" The courts ruled in favour of the drivers in 2016 and Uber lost a subsequent appeal in 2018. Now the US ride-haling firm has appealed again to the UK's Supreme Court, whose decision will be binding. Its judgement will affect the working rights of tens of thousands of Uber drivers across the UK, and could leave Uber facing a hefty compensation bill. Rachel Mathieson, of Bates Wells, the law firm representing the drivers, says there could wider consequences for the so-called gig economy. ""This landmark case will have enormous implications for how well, or badly, workers in the fastest growing sector of the economy are treated."" Mr Aslam and Mr Farrar argue that as drivers for Uber they should have been classed as employees because the firm had so much control over them. For example, Uber records passenger details but does not pass them on to drivers; it also stops drivers from providing their contact details to passengers, which drivers would be allowed to do if they were independent contractors. Uber drivers launch legal battle over 'favouritism' Uber loses licence to operate in London Mr Farrar, who now leads the United Private Hire Drivers' union, said that by classing drivers as freelancers, Uber avoided having to offer holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the national minimum wage. ""[Working for Uber] we are not in business on our own account. We are in business as part of somebody else's business,"" he told the BBC. ""I don't control the customer, I don't control the price. I'm effectively performance managed and I'm penalised. So I am definitely under Uber's control."" Uber argues that it isn't a traditional taxi firm, but a ""ride-hailing app"". It says it doesn't own a fleet of cars or employ any drivers, but acts as an agent - providing the technology to connect drivers with passengers and process payments. It pointed out that unlike taxis, Uber drivers aren't allowed to accept jobs where a customer hails them in the street. It all has to be done through the app. Uber also says thatdrivers like the flexibility of being freelance, and that its working practices have changed since 2016 when the case was first brought. For example, it says its drivers have more control over their business as they are now able to see a rider's destination before they choose to accept a trip. They also have no obligation to log on to Uber's taxi booking app. This video can not be played Two Uber drivers take opposing views on how the company should treat them The US firm said that 9,000 UK drivers benefited from its free health insurance in 2019, and a recent Oxford University study showed drivers in London were earning well above minimum wage. ""Over a number of years we've made significant changes to our app to offer more benefits with total flexibility,"" Mr Heywood said. If successful in their case, the Uber drivers could be entitled to an average of £12,000 each in compensation, according to law firm Leigh Day. The firm - which is representing drivers seeking compensation - believes tens of thousands of Uber drivers could be eligible to make a claim. However, Uber will only be legally required to compensate those who have brought a claim. Nigel Mackay, a partner in the employment team at Leigh Day, said: ""If Uber loses, it will have no other option but to compensate those drivers who have brought claims for failures to provide holiday pay and where the company has paid them below the minimum wage.""

The App Drivers & Couriers Union has launched a legal challenge in a bid to understand how the firm's algorithms pair drivers with ride requests. The union wants Uber to be more transparent about how the data it collects impacts drivers, and whether it leads to favouritism. Uber has always said that it does not manage its self-employed drivers. However the union alleges that Uber is monitoring drivers' performance, and claims that the firm is noting incidents of late arrivals, cancelled jobs and customer complaints about attitude or inappropriate behaviour against driver profiles. “This is about the distribution of power,” Anton Ekker, the privacy lawyer leading the case,told the Guardian,external. “It’s about Uber exerting control through data and automated decision-making, and how it is blocking access to that.” 'We're key workers but no-one's looking after us' Uber destroys thousands of bikes and scooters The union argues that under GDPR regulations, Uber drivers have the right to access their profiling data. It says such data can include evaluations of a worker's reliability, behaviour, attitude and the number of late arrivals or cancelled trips they have had. Two of its members, UK-based drivers Azeem Hanif and Alfie Wellcoat, allege that Uber has failed to fulfil its obligations in its response to their request. The group is asking the district court in Amsterdam, where Uber's headquarters are based, to order Uber to comply with data protection law.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Coronavirus: Uber announces drastic cuts to secure its future,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52711649,,"Uber has announced a drastic action plan to scale back its business as its losses balloon amid pandemic lockdowns. The firm said it would cut 3,000 more jobs, bringing the total reductions in recent weeks to a quarter of the workforce. It is also closing or consolidating more than 40 offices and winding down units such as its artificial intelligence lab. The head of the firm said the moves were necessary ""to secure our future"". ""We must establish ourselves as a self-sustaining enterprise that no longer relies on new capital or investors to keep growing, expanding and innovating,"" chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi wrote in a letter to staff. ""We have to take these hard actions to stand strong on our own two feet, to secure our future and to continue on our mission."" Even before the pandemic, Uber was grappling with huge losses. But its challenges have multiplied as activity plunges during the pandemic. The number of Uber rides dropped 80% last month at the height of the lockdowns in the US and Canada. Meanwhile, although its Uber Eats food delivery business has surged, it remains loss-making. Earlier this month,Uber announced it would cut 3,700 staffandwarned of possible additional reductions. The workforce cuts do not include drivers, whom Uber considers independent contractors. The affected offices include hubs in San Francisco and in Singapore, which will start closing over the next year as the firm selects a new regional headquarters. Uber said it would reorganise its remaining staff and cut back spending in areas that are not part of its core personal transport or food delivery businesses, including its AI Labs. Combined, the actions should reduce spending by $1bn, the company said. Uber's actions are the latest sign of the ongoing economic impact of the virus and efforts to control it. While some places have started to ease restrictions, many companies - especially those in the travel industry - have warned it will take time for public confidence in the safety of many everyday activities to be restored. Uber's smaller rival, Lyft, has also announced significant job cuts, as have airlines, hoteliers and booking platforms such as Airbnb. ""Given the dramatic impact of the pandemic, and the unpredictable nature of any eventual recovery, we are concentrating our efforts on our core mobility and delivery platforms and resizing our company to match the realities of our business,"" Mr Khosrowshahi said.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Coronavirus: Uber tells all drivers to wear face masks,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52656090,,"An AA engineer installing a perspex screen in a taxi for Uber Uber drivers and passengers in most countries will have to wear face masks from next week as the ride-hailing firm toughens its coronavirus policy. The new rule takes effect on Monday. It applies to services in the US, Canada, Mexico, India and most of Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. But the UK is not on the list, following government guidance which advises but does not require people to wear face coverings in confined spaces. Although it is not making it compulsory to wear a face mask in the UK, Uber said it had distributed free protective equipment to UK drivers, including more than a million single-use face masks, as well as 95,000 cleaning sprays. In the coming weeks, it will hand out another two million masks. ""As well as working with Unilever to provide drivers with free sanitising products, Uber is distributing millions of masks and directly reimbursing drivers if they choose to source the PPE themselves,"" an Uber spokesman told the BBC. At the same time, Uber, along with taxi firm Addison Lee, has announced new safety measures as the government looks to ease coronavirus restrictions and people return to work. Addison Lee will fit perspex partition screens between drivers and passengers across its 4,000 vehicles next week. And Uber is paying the AA to install partitions in 400 cars in Newcastle, Sunderland and Durham as part of an initial pilot. United Private Hire Drivers union wants it to be mandatory for both drivers and passengers to wear masks during journeys ""We know there is significant demand from drivers, passengers, businesses and the general public for more to be done to make transport cleaner and safer as we go back to work - including calls for the introduction of partition screens into private hire vehicles,"" said Liam Griffin, chief executive of London-based Addison Lee. ""That's why we have taken the decision to begin rolling out the installation of safety screens between drivers and passenger seats."" Uber said its pilot in the North East of England was crucial for the company to get a better understanding of how to carry passengers on journeys as safely as possible. Uber is first trialling the partition screens in areas where it has been able to gain the permission of the regulator or city council, in order to ensure that the screens are installed safely. Coronavirus: Taxi drivers demand safety screens Coronavirus: The taxi drivers left 'desperate' by the lockdown Uber says 'no sacred cows' amid coronavirus crisis On Wednesday, Transport for London (TfL) updated its guidance for taxi and private hire vehicle firms. The regulator is advising firms to have drivers and passengers socially distance, with passengers sitting in the back seats of cars. It advised drivers to carry a bottle of hand sanitiser gel in their vehicle that contains at least 60% alcohol. However, when it comes to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks, gloves or partition walls, TfL said it is waiting to hear from the London Strategic Coordination Group (SCG) on recommendations before mandating additional coronavirus prevention and control measures for taxis and private hire vehicles. The BBC understands that a number of taxi firms in the UK are seeking clarification from the government on health and safety precautions to take once the lockdown ends, and would prefer regulation rather than advice. In Wales,taxi drivers told the BBC they experience anxiety with every passenger they pick up, and are still waiting for approval from their local councils before they can make any modifications to their vehicles, such as installing a screen. ""Two months into a public health emergency which has seen private hire drivers suffer one of the highest occupational mortality rates, yet TfL and the Department for Transport (DfT) are still not taking responsibility to introduce necessary safety controls,"" James Farrar, chair of the United Private Hire Drivers trade body, told the BBC. ""Poor regulatory standards and employment misclassification has become a lethal combination for desperately exploited drivers."" Taxi drivers have lost a lot of their income during the coronavirus income, as cities like Cardiff stand mostly deserted The trade body is similarly concerned that Uber is not providing partition screens to its drivers in other parts of the UK, such as London, which has the largest concentration of Uber drivers in the country. Mr Farrar wants to see Uber commit to limiting bookings to no more than two passengers per vehicle, and to make the wearing of masks mandatory for both drivers and passengers. For now, there is no evidence available that demonstrates that partitions in taxis will reduce the risk of transmitting the coronavirus. But there is some evidence that the use of cloth face coverings can help to reduce transmission of coronavirus infection where it is not possible for people to maintain a distance of 2m.

""There are no sacred cows,"" said the taxi-hailing app's chief financial officer Nelson Chai. It follows Uber's announcement on Wednesday that it would cut about 14% of its staff. That move, and others the firm has made, will save more than $1bn (£810m) this year, but more measures may be necessary Mr Chai said on Thursday. Uber, known for its ride-hailing app, has also ventured into other areas, such as driverless cars and freight. But since chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over after the ouster of founder Travis Kalanick, the firm has concentrated more on its rides and food delivery business. As the pandemic takes a financial toll, executives warned that they are looking for places to cut. ""We're taking a hard look at our overall cost structure...to ensure our core business of rides and eats emerges stronger than ever,"" Mr Khosrowshahi told investors in a call to discuss the firm's quarterly results. Uber axes 3,700 staff as trips drop in lockdowns Uber and Lyft sued by California, accused of denying driver benefits Uber said revenue in the three months to 31 March 2020 reached $3.5bn, up 14% year-on-year, in part due to increased food delivery. But the firm's losses surged to $2.9bn, compared to $1bn a year ago. Some of the decline was due to write-downs of the worth of minority investments. The firm was also hit by a drop in demand, as countries began to institute stay-at-home orders. Uber's rides business - which contributes the bulk of its revenue - was down 80% in April, after the orders were instituted, Mr Khosrowshahi said. But he added that he was encouraged by signs of recovery. In Hong Kong, for example, Mr Khosrowshahi said demand has returned to about 70% of its pre-crisis levels. In Texas and Georgia, where officials have relaxed restrictions, he said ridership has also been increasing slightly in recent weeks. Mr Khosrowshahi said that the crisis would delay the firm's goal of becoming profitable by a matter of ""quarters, not years"". ""We're going to continue to look for more efficiencies. The reality is the world has changed and we don't know when the recovery is going to be,"" said Mr Chai. ""We're going to take the actions that we think are necessary.""

Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi will also waive his base salary - set at $1m (£809,690) in 2019 - through to the year end. The announcements come a day ahead of the firm's quarterly results. Even before the pandemic, Uber was struggling to balance its books, making a loss of $8.5bn in 2019. Uber said the reductions will come from its customer support and recruiting teams, and would result in $20m in severance pay and other costs. Executives in March warned the firm had seen demand for its taxi services fall by more than 60% in coronavirus hotspots, though they said ordering via its Uber Eats food delivery service had increased. ""Since we don't know how long a recovery will take, we are taking steps to bring our costs in line with the size of our business today,"" the firm said in a statement on Wednesday. The Uber Eats food delivery service has seen increased demand Uber's business is heavily reliant on big cities, including some that have been most affected by the pandemic. Last year, four metro areas in the US, including New York and San Francisco, and London accounted for 23% of the money spent on the platform. Analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities called the job cuts ""painful but necessary"", noting that both Uber and smaller rival Lyft face long-term difficulties as more people work from home and avoid taxis for fear of infection. ""Uber and Lyft face Herculean-like challenges looking ahead as the new reality will likely change the business models of these companies [and competitors] for the foreseeable future,"" he wrote in a note. On Wednesday, Lyft said it had seen a decline of more than 70% in trips on its platform as the US started to implement shutdown orders. It said it was taking aggressive cost-cutting steps to help the business survive. The firm last week announced plans to axe about 17% of its workforce or almost 1,000 employees, furlough another 300 people and reduce executive pay. ""We face a new reality,"" said co-founder Logan Green. ""We expect that rider demand for our platform will be down for the foreseeable future."" The reductions are a sign that the impact from the shutdowns is continuing to ripple out into the US economy, with economists now bracing for a prolonged slowdown rather than a quick rebound.

The move followsthe landmark law the state passed last yearto clarify rules for so-called gig-workers. Uber said it would contest the claims. The transportation giant and smaller rival Lyft had unsuccessfully opposed California's law when it was under discussion last year, saying it would reduce flexibility valued by drivers. The companies are now trying to win support among state voters for ballot proposal that would exempt them from the law. Uber has also challenged the law in court. ""At a time when California's economy is in crisis with four million people out of work, we need to make it easier, not harder for people to quickly start earning,"" Uber said in response to the lawsuit. ""We will contest this action in court while at the same time pushing to raise the standard of independent work for drivers in California, including with guaranteed minimum earnings and new benefits."" Lyft said: ""We are looking forward to working with the Attorney General and mayors all across the state to bring all the benefits of California's innovation economy to as many workers as possible"".

BBC,0.05855610077732243,The Uber driver evicted from home and left to die of coronavirus,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52413431,,"The last time Mary Jayaseelan spoke to her husband Rajesh, he was about to be hooked up to a ventilator in a Covid ward. Rajesh was being treated in Northwick Park Hospital in London, the city where he worked as an Uber driver for most of the year. Mary was 5,000 miles away in their family home in Bangalore, India, with their two young sons. Until that point he had repeatedly told her he would be fine, that he was feeling ill but she was not to worry, he'd get better - at 44 years old, he was young and otherwise healthy. But on that call, he broke down and admitted: ""Mary, I'm feeling a bit scared."" Rajesh Jayaseelan died the following day. Rajesh and Mary got married on 24 February 2014, and rented a home in Hulimavu, south Bangalore, that they shared with his 66-year-old mum. For most of the year, Rajesh rented a room in Harrow, north London and drove an Uber vehicle in the city. He'd work from late in the evening to the early hours of the morning - the busy hours - so he could save enough money to spend a few months with his family in India. He enjoyed working as a driver, although he didn't realise that his precarious gig economy job would leave him vulnerable in the global health crisis that would later emerge. ""He'd been living in London on-and-off for 22 years, and would come back to India for a few months at a time,"" Mary says. ""He loved London. He always used to talk to me about how beautiful London was, and so clean. I've never been to London, so he would describe it to me."" They were very happy. Rajesh loved his wife, and playing with their two sons, aged six and four. When he wasn't in India he would video-call them every day. ""He was also a really good singer,"" Mary says, full of pride. ""He sang a lot of Hindi songs."" He was also a ""humble, gentle person"" his close friend Sunil Kumar adds. Sunil and Rajesh first met in 2011 - they were both from Bangalore, so mutual friends there put them in touch when Sunil moved to the UK. They would help each other navigate the UK's various bureaucratic systems, loaned each other small amounts of money when needed, and Sunil and his wife would have Rajesh over for meals at their home in Hertfordshire - sending him back with several days' worth of leftovers of delicious South Indian food. Although Rajesh loved London, he didn't plan to stay forever - he wanted to be reunited with his family in India. Renting their home in Hulimavu was relatively expensive, so during his last stay in Bangalore at the end of 2019, he and his wife took out a loan and bought land to build their own home. The loan was no problem, they thought - Rajesh would go back to London and put enough money aside to pay it off. The next time he travelled to Bangalore, he told his wife, it would be for good. He came back to London on 15 January. Less than two weeks later, the first cases of coronavirus were reported in the UK. Rajesh and Mary on their wedding day in February 2014 Although the virus had reached Britain, at this point Rajesh wasn't too worried. Shops and restaurants were still open, people were still going into work and then going out. For everyone, including Uber drivers, it was business as usual, and not much changed for another month. Then March came around, and the virus was passing from person to person within the UK. The number of cases - and, by now, deaths - was increasing every day. People were told to self-isolate for seven days if they had any symptoms - even mild ones, such as a fever or a persistent cough. On 23 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown lasting an initial three weeks, meaning that most businesses would close, and people would only be allowed outside for one form of exercise a day and for essential trips to the shops, unless they were considered ""essential"" workers. Like many Uber drivers, Rajesh continued to work at first, but he quickly developed flu-like symptoms and had to stop. His last job was on 25 March - a drop-off at Heathrow Airport. His symptoms became much worse, and he was admitted to the hospital with dehydration. While there, he was tested for the coronavirus. It came back positive. Staff told Rajesh to go home, self-isolate, and to come back if his symptoms got worse. He did as he was told, and went home to his room. But things were about to get even worse. ""The landlord sent Rajesh out of the house for something, and when he came back the landlord had changed the locks, so he couldn't get in,"" Mary says. ""He tried knocking on the door and asking the landlord to speak to him, but he wouldn't open the door."" His landlord didn't know about his positive diagnosis - but he told him that, as an Uber driver, he might bring the coronavirus back into the house, and that it wasn't a risk he was willing to take. With nowhere else to turn, Rajesh was forced to sleep in his car for several nights. ""He had no food in there, nothing to eat at all,"" Mary says. At this point he called his friend Sunil for advice. ""That was the last call he made to me,"" Sunil says. ""He didn't go into details about what was happening to him, but because I work in the NHS, he was asking me questions like 'How safe are we', 'Is it better to go to India'… things like that. He was asking me if I knew any routes, if there was any possible way he could go - he wanted to go to India and be with his family. But by that time there was a complete lockdown in India too."" Sunil told him the best thing to do would be to stay at home, not to work, and to look into the financial support for self-employed workers the government had just announced, or the 14 days' assistance offered by Uber. Rajesh agreed, and explained he needed to find a new place to live because his landlord said he was high risk. But, Sunil says, he didn't say that he'd already been kicked out: ""He may have been embarrassed."" Rajesh then went back to trying to call his landlord to plead with him to let him stay. There was no answer. After days of searching, he eventually found another room in a shared house in Harrow. The new landlord made him pay £4,000 upfront - money he didn't have, and Mary says he had to borrow. If your landlord kicks you out of your home without giving you notice, or locks you out of your home, it is likely to be an illegal eviction - a criminal offence in all UK nations. This is still the case during the coronavirus pandemic. Under the Coronavirus Act, notice periods for evictions have been extended to three months. ""This means that for most private and social tenants, even if they receive an eviction notice they're likely to have the legal right to stay in their home,"" Andy Parnell, helpline adviser for housing charity Shelter, tells the BBC. But, he says, ""sadly there are some groups not protected by the recent changes to the evictions law, including lodgers with live-in landlords"". ""Lodgers have fewer rights than private renters with live-out landlords and landlords don't need to go to court to evict a lodger. But they are required to provide reasonable notice before asking them to leave the property."" People in Rajesh's situation should call the local council's homelessness team as soon as possible and all councils have an emergency out-of-hours number. If you don't have anywhere to sleep, you should go to the council's office in person, bringing ID and any proof of immigration status with you. Earlier this month, Shelter alsotold renters in this situation to ""stay put"". Once Rajesh was back indoors, he didn't want to risk being evicted again. He hid himself away and avoided contact with his new landlord and all the other tenants, not even daring to try and cook a meal for himself. His health became worse with every passing day. The only social interaction he had were daily phone calls with his wife, where he would alternate between reassuring her that he would be fine, and crying. It was during one of these calls that Mary noticed he was struggling to breathe. ""He was wheezing a lot in that room, and every day it was getting worse,"" she says. ""One night I told him to go to the hospital. He didn't want to call an ambulance because he didn't want others there to know he was ill, in case he was evicted again."" Rajesh drove himself to the hospital, despite being severely out of breath. When he got there he was diagnosed with pneumonia. ""The next morning he called me from the hospital for a video call - but when the children saw him they started crying because of how ill he was,"" Mary says. ""He turned off his video, and told me he didn't want them to remember him looking so unwell."" They would speak only a few more times. On 11 April, the doctors caring for Rajesh called Mary and explained that he was in a critical state, and they didn't think his condition would improve. They arranged a video call for her and the children to see him one final time; he was unconscious. He died two hours later. While ""coronavirus doesn't discriminate"" has been repeated often during this pandemic, it is evident that the virus is worse for some than others. One group hit particularly hard are gig economy workers. The gig economy is where people take on short-term or freelance work instead of permanent jobs. These include private-hire cab drivers like Rajesh as well as food delivery workers and couriers. Last year about 4.7 million people in the UK worked in gig economy jobs while, according to a 2018 study,60% of the global population,externalis in insecure work. Research by the World Economic Forum and other bodies shows these workers are disproportionately affected by the pandemic - a combination of being classified as ""essential"" workers, requiring them to continue interacting with strangers; a lack of guaranteed paid sick leave that makes it harder to self-isolate; low and insecure pay, making it more likely for them to be living in dangerous and insecure housing situations; and no entitlement to risk assessments or protective equipment. Ayako Ebata, from the Institute of Development Studies, says because people in insecure work ""heavily rely on their daily wages"", they are under a lot of pressure not to lose their jobs or take time off, even when there are significant health risks. ""It's not because they're ignorant or uninformed, it's because the whole system is forcing them to make decisions that eventually prove detrimental to their livelihoods and health,"" she says. Dr Alex Wood, a sociologist at Oxford University focusing on the gig economy and insecure work, agrees - and says a lack of workplace protection makes the problem much worse. ""People have been told by these platforms that they don't need to worry about [rights and protections] because when the economy's fine, there isn't really any risk,"" he says. ""In reality, when you have these crises, it's the workers who pay - despite many of them now being classified as 'essential'."" Now, drivers in the UK are calling for greater protection from the government. United Private Hire Drivers (UPHD), an independent trade body for private-hire drivers, has this week called for an urgent judicial review on the matter. ""What the government is saying now is that it's not safe for you to go to a barbershop, but it's somehow safe for you to ride around in an Uber,"" James Farrar from the UPHD says. Race is a risk factor, too. According to multiple recent studies, BAME people in the UK like Rajesh are disproportionately more likely to be in insecure work than their white counterparts. Research from the Trade Union Congress (TUC) last year found thatethnic minority workers are a third more likely to be in insecure work. A report released last month by Carnegie UK Trust, UCL and Operation Black Vote also found that BAME millennials in particular were 47% more likely to be on ""zero-hours"" contracts - another notoriously unstable form of work. At the same time, recent studies show that BAME people in the UK are disproportionately more likely to become critically ill and to die from coronavirus. Ethnic minority patients make up 34% of those in intensive care, despite making up only 13% of the population. Early research suggests this is down to a combination of risk factors - an increased incidence of high-risk underlying health conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, as well as social factors and systemic inequality. ""Coronavirus is making a lot of the inequalities in our society that we had previously turned a blind eye to, very clear,"" Dr Wood says. After learning that her son had died, Rajesh's mother became ill. She suffered hypertension and a spike in her blood sugar level, and has been confined to her bed. ""She's been inconsolable since,"" Mary says. Faced with a loan for the house, upcoming medical bills and children's school fees, Mary is trying to find work as a cleaner in their area but the lockdown is making it much more difficult to get on top of their finances. Sunil is helping them with money where he can, and has set upan online fundraiser for them,external. He's also looking into whether he can pursue legal action against Rajesh's first landlord, and Mary's relatives in Bangalore have set up a fundraiser for her in India. Uber also contacted the BBC to offer their condolences. But more than anything, Mary is struggling to come to terms with how quickly everything has changed for her family. ""Now that Rajesh is gone, our life has become very difficult,"" she says. ""I don't know what we'll do without him.""

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Coronavirus: Uber and Deliveroo offer NHS free trips and food,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52092722,,"Ride hailing giant Uber and takeaway firm Deliveroo are offering hundreds of thousands of free trips and meals to NHS staff fighting the coronavirus. Uber is giving away 200,000 rides worth up to £15 and 100,000 free meals worth up to £10. Deliveroo said it would deliver 500,000 hot dishes to NHS Trusts from the likes of Pizza Hut, Itsu and Neat Burger. However, unions say the firms are ""still failing"" to support their own low-paid workers during the crisis. Johnson hails return of 20,000 former NHS staff F1 team helps to create coronavirus breathing aid Under its offer, Uber said NHS workers could claim up to 10 car rides or cycle trips per week and five meal vouchers. It said drivers would get the full fare on the trips as Uber will not charge a service fee. Deliveroo said hospitals would be able to order hot dishes with it directly, not via its app, starting in London and Manchester, then in all the regions it covers. It is funding the effort through private donations and corporate contributions, with Pizza Hut having offered to provide 300,000 of the hot dishes. Health Secretary Matt Hancock praised both firms for ""playing their part in this great national effort"". Earlier in March, Uber and Deliveroo both said they would pay workers for 14 days if they fell sick, as long as they could provide sick notes. But due to a lack of testing and doctors' appointments, many could not access help until 21 March when the NHS 111 phone service began offering notes. The IGWB union said NHS 111 could only backdate a note six days, meaning many drivers would still miss out. Greg Howard, a Deliveroo rider and the secretary of the IWGB's couriers and logistics branch, said: ""It's great that Uber and Deliveroo are assisting some front line workers, but its own workers are still being failed by the companies.

It comes nearly two years after one of Uber's self-driving cars was involved in a fatal crash in Arizona. Uber scaled back its autonomous car operations following the incident. Receiving a permit in California - which has granted permits to 65 other transport firms - is the latest step in Uber's revival of the programme. California allows companies to test self-driving technology with a backup driver in the car. Before the fatal crash, Uber's self-driving cars were being tested in four locations in North America - Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. Uber said it is considering using San Francisco, where the company is based, again. It did not give a timeline for when it will resume testing. ""We do not have an update as to exactly when we'll resume autonomous testing,"" the company said in a statement. It added: ""Receiving our testing permit through the California Department of Motor Vehicles is a critical step towards that end in Uber's home city"". California has granted permits to 66 companies in total to test autonomous vehicles, but Uber is the only one that has been involved in a fatal crash. Uber stopped its testing on public roads following a crash in March 2018 that took the life of Elaine Herzberg, aged 49. Ms Herzberg was crossing a poorly lit stretch of a multi-lane road with her bicycle in Arizona when she was struck by a Volvo XC90 using Uber's self-driving technology. An investigation into the crash found the car's backup driver, Rafaela Vasquez, had taken her eyes off the road moments before. Records also showed that she was streaming a television show on her phone during that time. In 2019, prosecutors ruled that Uber was not criminally liable for the crash.An earlier police report said the incident was ""entirely avoidable"". Uber said its self-driving programme ""underwent an overhaul"" following the incident. Uber's self-driving operations resumed in Pittsburgh in 2018. The company also plans to begin testing in Washington DC later this year. Self-driving technology is seen as crucial for Uber's efforts to eventually turn a profit.

""Even though Uber Eats had the advantage of 'global experience', the Indian market is very different from a developed market - the price points and strategies.

Correspondents say the deal will further intensify the competition between Zomato and Swiggy. Suranjana Tewari, BBC News, Mumbai Food delivery services have become integral to daily life in India. Corporate professionals rely on aggregators to deliver their lunch at work every day - restaurants and kitchens have been able to expand their customer base considerably as a result and tens of millions of people across the country have become accustomed to getting their favourite meal delivered directly to their doorstep every day. With a cab aggregator service already firmly established in the country, and a large population, Uber's entry into the Indian food delivery market was a no brainer. But the parent company was under pressure to reduce loss-making businesses since going public last May, and Uber Eats was bleeding money. This is the latest sale for Uber after it exited businesses in Russia, China and Southeast Asia in recent years. So, why is the Indian market so competitive? It is crowded with indigenous apps such as Zomato and Swiggy that were already operating in hundreds of towns and cities across India. They had attracted a strong customer base to their extensive catalogue of restaurant partners. But their real appeal was deep discounts, a must for the Indian customer. Zomato has run into a lot of controversy regarding its offers but for now, it seems to have given the startup an edge. The fight for India's food delivery market is now pretty much a duopoly between Zomato, backed by Alibaba, and Swiggy, which is backed by another Chinese tech giant - Tencent. But all is not lost for Uber. By retaining a stake in Zomato, it'll ride the wave of success the Indian startup is enjoying - but as a backer, rather than a loss-making rival.

A 17-year-old male was found guilty of manslaughter but cleared of murder. Jadan Richards, 19, was one of three teenagers found guilty of killing Iderval Da Silva Prosecutor Tony Badenoch QC had told the trial how Brazilian Mr Da Silva had parked his scooter outside a Battersea cafe. A group of young men spotted the unattended moped and one of them tried to snatch it, he said. When Mr Da Silva tried to stop him, he was set upon in a ""momentary explosion of short-lived violence"". Iderval Da Silva was kicked and punched when he tried to stop a group of teenagers stealing his moped He was left unconscious on the ground and died three days later from a bleed on the brain, the court heard. Jasire Frazer, 18, from Wandsworth, and a 17-year-old were cleared of both murder and manslaughter. Another 17-year-old boy was cleared on the judge's direction midway through the trial. Judge Mark Dennis QC adjourned sentencing until 5 February. Paramedics treated Iderval da Silva on Charlotte Despard Avenue after thieves tried to take his moped from a nearby car park Sally-Anne Russell, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""This is a tragic case of a man who died trying to protect his property. ""Witnesses watched on in horror as the unprovoked attack unfolded. ""They rushed to Mr Da Silva's aid after the attackers fled, but the level of violence was such that a few days later Mr Da Silva died from his injuries."" Det Insp Tariq Farooqi, of the Met Police, said the guilty teenagers ""were ferocious and heartless in the way they attacked him"". ""The attackers, who are all known to each other, clearly set out that day to commit crime. ""Because of this, a family have lost a truly loved individual who was trying to provide for his son and extended family members."" Second teenager charged with man's murder HM Courts Service..."

The 43-year-old ousted the ride-hailing firm's original chief executive within a year of its creation, but was himself forced tostand down six-and-a-half years later in 2017after a number of scandals. He had, however, remained involved as one of its nine directors. Mr Kalanick also recently sold off most of his shares in the company. In the past two months he has liquidated about $2.5bn (£1.9bn) worth of stock, representing more than 90% of his earlier stake in the business. ""At the close of the decade, and with the company now public, it seems like the right moment for me to focus on my current business and philanthropic pursuits,""said Mr Kalanick in a statement issued by Uber,external.

The Los Angeles-based start-up buys up land and establishes kitchens for use by delivery-only restaurants, which operate via apps including Uber Eats. The entrepreneur had previously declared: ""I love Uber more than anything in the world."" However, investors pressured him to step aside in the run up to the company's flotation following a series of controversies. They had involved: a report that another executive had obtained the medical records of a woman who was raped by an Uber driver in 2014, and then shared them with Mr Kalanick among others hundreds of complaints from staff about harassment and bullying a legal dispute with Google's parent company Alphabet over the alleged theft of trade secrets related to driverless cars an argument between Mr Kalanick and one of Uber's San Francisco drivers over fares, which was filmed and released to the media Mr Kalanick had also repeatedly clashed with regulators, which had helped Uber overcome and sometimes ignore restrictions that would have otherwise prevented it entering some markets. But there was a perception that the company's image had been tarnished as a consequence, and that his replacement - Expedia's former chief Dara Khosrowshahi - would be seen as a less risky bet by the markets once the firm had listed. But Mr Khosrowshahi has paid his own respects following the latest announcement. ""Very few entrepreneurs have built something as profound as Travis Kalanick did with Uber,"" he said. ""I'm enormously grateful for Travis' vision and tenacity while building Uber, and for his expertise as a board member.""

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber promises changes to avoid Germany ban,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50865154,,"Uber says it will make changes to avoid being banned in Germany, after a court ruled some of its processes did not respect local law. In Germany, the app connects passengers to private hire vehicle and taxi firms, rather than independent drivers. But trade body Taxi Deutschland complained that some of Uber's processes broke Germany's rules on passenger transport. Uber said it would continue to operate in Germany while it made changes. In most countries where Uber operates, the company connects passengers with independent drivers who have signed up to offer rides in their cars. In the UK and in some other countries, the drivers must be insured and - in some cases - require a license to offer rides to the public. The company used to offer a service in Germany called UberPop, which connected riders with unlicensed drivers. However,a German court banned it in 2015following a complaint from Taxi Deutschland. Since then, Uber has worked with licensed private hire vehicle companies in Germany, so passengers using the app get picked up by a driver from a traditional private hire firm. But Taxi Deutschland said some of Uber's practices violated the country's Passenger Transportation Act, which became law in the 1980s. German law says private hire drivers must return back to their company's base after completing a trip, if they do not have another journey lined up. Drivers are not allowed to drive around or park somewhere waiting for a new job to come in. The complaint said Uber had not done enough to make sure the private hire companies it worked with respected this rule. The law also says that private hire jobs must be accepted by the business, rather than the individual driver. So, when somebody uses the Uber app in Germany, the company finds nearby drivers and then has to send the booking request to the driver's despatch office. The job must then be accepted and sent to the driver by a human despatch operator. The process cannot be automated. The complaint said Uber had also failed to enforce this rule. In a statement, the company said: ""We will assess the court's ruling and determine next steps to ensure our service in Germany continues. ""Working with licensed private hire vehicle operators and their professional drivers, we are committed to being a true partner to German cities for the long term."" The company is deciding whether to appeal against the court's finding. It can continue to operate for now, but Taxi Deutschland said it would seek enforcement of the court's decision, which would see the company fined if it continued to offer rides. Uber has faced increase scrutiny over its business practices. In 2017,Europe's top court ruled that Uber was a transport companyrather than just an ""information society service"", because the company decided the fares passengers were charged. In November, London's transport authorityTFL said it would not extend Uber's licenceto operate in the capital.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,"Uber had 6,000 US sexual assault reports in two years",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50682175,,"Uber said it received almost 6,000 reports of sexual assault in the United States in 2017 and 2018. While the number of cases rose in 2018, the rate of incidents dropped by 16%, as the number of journeys was higher. Passengers - as opposed to drivers - accounted for nearly half of those accused of sexual assault. The data was published ina report which Uber said showed its commitment,externalto ""improving safety for Uber and the entire industry"". Uber is facing growing scrutiny around the world, and recentlylost its licence to operate in London. The report showed 5,981 sexual assault incidents were reported out of the 2.3bn US trips over the two-year period. Uber claimed 99.9% of the total journeys were concluded without safety issues. Uber: Will it get its London licence back? 'Uber genuinely was a lifeline' What do drivers think of Uber? Uber saidthe report was the first comprehensive safety review of its ride-hailing business.,external ""Voluntarily publishing a report that discusses these difficult safety issues is not easy,"" said Tony West, chief legal officer at Uber. ""Most companies don't talk about issues like sexual violence because doing so risks inviting negative headlines and public criticism. But we feel it's time for a new approach."" The company told the BBC there were currently no concrete plans to release safety reports for any non-US markets. This is a hugely significant document that for the first time details the extent to which the gig economy puts people in harm's way. Uber described it as a complex project that was two years in the making, with much of that time spent auditing the data to ensure accuracy. It should be noted that, knowing it would provoke grim headlines, the firm opted to release this data voluntarily. The firm has committed to releasing the report every two years. Now that Uber has proven it can produce this data in a digestible form, it must keep doing so at regular intervals and, eventually, for all its markets around the world. That's not an easy undertaking, but the company can afford it. Continual publication of the report would bring focus and urgency: is Uber's record on safety getting better or worse? Why might that be? Are certain regions safer than others? What can we learn from that? Attention must also turn to the other gig economy firms out there. Lyft - which is facing a lawsuit over sexual assault filed just this week - has no excuses now that its bigger rival has acted. Uber said 3,045 sexual assault reports were made in 2018 compared with 2,936 in 2017. Last year, 1.3 billion trips were completed in the US, up from one billion in 2017. The head of the US National Sexual Violence Resource Center, Karen Baker, welcomed the report, saying it ""provides an opportunity to shed light on how this information-sharing emboldens our work for a safer future"". Passenger safety, in particular sexual violence, have been major challenges for Uber and its US rival Lyft, as well as China's Didi. In November,London's transport regulator announced that Uber would not be granted a new licence to operate after repeated safety issues. The firm has appealed against the ruling and continues to operate during the process. Uber loses licence to operate in London Uber: Will it get its London licence back?

Sefton said its licensed drivers were of ""high quality"" and Wolverhampton said Uber was ""fit and proper"". In a statement, Uber said: ""We work closely with licensing authorities across the country and want to reassure all councils that we have robust processes in place."" Uber's licence in Manchester expires on 31 July 2021. Its licences to operate in Birmingham and Newcastle-upon-Tyne are due to expire next year and in 2021 respectively. Both will review how the company operates. Earlier this week,Transport for London (TfL) decided not to renew Uber's licencein the capital after discovering that 14,000 fraudulent trips occurred on the company's app. These happened when unlicensed drivers were able to use legitimate drivers' Uber accounts. Manchester City Council's licensing requirements include: Private vehicles can be no more than three years old when their owners apply for a licence Mandatory vetting of drivers in the form of a DBS certificate that is checked quarterly Regular patrols by council officers to ensure drivers comply with its licence However, other councils have different rules in place. Under the 2015 Deregulation Act, drivers are allowed to work outside the area for which they are licensed. A spokesperson for Sefton Council added: ""We are confident that our application process ensures that all drivers and vehicles meet high standards and as long as each application meets all the relevant checks and tests for drivers and vehicles, a licence should be approved.""

He said he had no idea the man - called Doug - had paid the fare until he arrived at Addenbrooke's Hospital. ""When the chips are down, human nature kicks in and people can be very caring,"" he said. Mr Oates, from Swaffham Bulbeck, said he came off his bike ""without warning"" at the junction of New Street and Coldham's Lane at about 17:45 GMT.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber: Three views on the loss of its London licence,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50547981,,"On Monday, London's transport authority told taxi hailing firm Uber it would not extend its licence to operate in the capital. The firm said it would appeal against Transport for London's (TfL) decision, the latest twist in two years of friction between Uber and the local government. In 2017, Uber also lost its licence, until it won an appeal. It then received a two-month licence in September, which lapsed on Sunday. Users will still be able to use the service while Uber appeals. Uber branded the move as ""extraordinary and wrong"", while London Mayor Sadiq Khan said there had been 14,000 fraudulent trips in London in late 2018 and early 2019, and that ""safety is the paramount concern"". The BBC spoke to three London-based customers and drivers about their experiences with the firm. Uber ""was especially important to me when I broke my leg and relied on it to transport me everywhere. Without Uber I would not have gone out at all and would have been miserable,"" says Rachel Wilkinson, who works in business research. She says she feels for those with mobility problems who might be more permanently reliant on hiring cars, especially when the alternative is pricier private hires and black cabs. ""Uber genuinely was a lifeline,"" she said. Ms Wilkinson says she feels more pressure should be put on TfL to modernise black cabs with the same information available to Uber passengers, and to make them cheaper. ""I do want to make sure I'm driving with someone secure and safe,"" she says, adding that Uber should monitor and assess drivers. The service has allowed her to ditch her car. ""Instead of wasting money on a car I only used at weekends, paying crazy parking and congestion charges and clogging up the roads, Uber allows me to use a car when I need to and not worry about it the rest of the time. ""I'd have thought that given the insane congestion in London, this would a positive thing for the local government too."" Kay, who didn't want to give her surname, said her experience with Uber wasn't good. She had used the app for about five years until she had an experience that made her uncomfortable enough to abandon her ride. ""I am sad for the genuine drivers who will lose their jobs,"" she said. ""But Uber itself? No."" She says that after what turned into a disagreement about the route, her driver ignored one of her directions, driving quickly past her turn, and she chose to end the ride. When she complained, Uber offered her £5. She gave the driver a one star review on the app - the worst possible - after which her driver complained about her. The company threatened to suspend her account. There were no apologies for having been made to feel so uncomfortable, she said. ""I was forced, late at night, to abandon the ride... Don't worry about banning my account [Uber]. I won't be using you again anyway. I don't think they take complaints seriously enough,"" she said. An Uber spokeswoman said: ""We take all reports of this nature very seriously and investigate thoroughly. We typically prevent drivers from using the app during investigations and if the allegations prove true, an individual would likely face permanent deactivation. We work closely with the police to assist with any investigation."" Muhammad Ali has been driving for Uber for nine months ""I knew it was going to happen,"" says Muhammad Ali, who has been driving for Uber for nine months after a 19-year private hire career. He says he feels that TfL care more about drivers of London's black cabs. He says he was shocked about the news of so many unlicensed trips, but believes Uber is a good company to work for. ""I know how this business works,"" he says. ""I think they are driver-friendly."" He says not having to handle cash is a big boon for him as a driver, together with all the other things the Uber software takes care of. This includes the jobs that a human operator would normally be in charge of, such as allocating good routes. ""This is the only company I work for. It is my full-time job. If Uber loses its licence I'll be out of a job,"" he says. That said, he certainly feels that Uber ""should get their house in order sort out all the issues TfL have pointed out"".

The regulator said the taxi app was not ""fit and proper"" as a licence holder, despite having made a number of positive changes to its operations. Uber initially lost its licence in 2017 but was granted two extensions, the most recent of which expires on Monday. The firm will appeal and can continue to operate during that process. London is one of Uber's top five markets globally and it has about 45,000 drivers in the city. Overall, there are 126,000 licensed private hire and black cabs in the capital. If its appeal is unsuccessful, some think Uber drivers would move over to rival ride-sharing firms such as Bolt and Kapten.""There would be competition that would fill that void quite quickly,"" Fiona Cincotta, a market analyst at City Index told the BBC. TfL said it had identified a ""pattern of failures"" in London that placed passenger safety at risk. These included a change to Uber's systems which allowed unauthorised drivers to upload their photos to other Uber driver accounts. It meant there were at least 14,000 fraudulent trips in London in late 2018 and early 2019, TfL said. The regulator also found dismissed or suspended drivers had been able to create Uber accounts and carry passengers.  In one example, a driver was able to continue working for Uber, despite the fact his private hire licence had been revoked after he was cautioned for distributing indecent images of children. Uber's paradox: Gig work app traps and frees its drivers What do drivers think of Uber? Helen Chapman, director of licensing at TfL, said: ""While we recognise Uber has made improvements, it is unacceptable that Uber has allowed passengers to get into minicabs with drivers who are potentially unlicensed and uninsured."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""I know this decision may be unpopular with Uber users, but their safety is the paramount concern. Regulations are there to keep Londoners safe."" Donna Stevens says her experiences of using Uber in London have ""always been positive"". In her job as a carer she often works late, so regularly uses the service. ""The drivers are friendly, courteous and professional. I can't afford to get a metered taxi."" She says that if Uber were to go, she would probably have to go back to using public transport late at night, which does not make her feel safe. However, another reader, Kay, says she would not be sad to see Uber go. ""I complained a couple of months ago about a driver who made me feel so uncomfortable I abandoned the ride and walked home in the dark at 11 o'clock at night instead of staying in his cab."" She says Uber gave her a £5 credit but did not apologise. ""How is it OK to employ drivers that make women feel unsafe?"" she says. Uber lovers in London, fear not! The company's cars will not suddenly disappear from the capital's streets. Uber is going to appeal against this decision so a magistrate will have to decide whether Uber is fit to hold a licence in London, or not. A decision from a magistrates court could take weeks or months and unless the court decides otherwise, Uber will retain its licence during this period too. When TfL decided not to renew Uber's licence in 2017, the company addressed some of the issues raised by TfL back then and then a magistrate later granted Uber a new licence. On the face of it TfL is standing tough against perceived failings by Uber. But in effect it is letting the courts decide, at a later date, whether Uber should have a licence, or not. Uber said the decision was ""extraordinary and wrong"". It said it had audited every driver in London over the past two months and strengthened its processes. Boss Dara Khosrowshahi tweeted: ""We understand we're held to a high bar, as we should be. But this TfL decision is just wrong.

In a public filing, it said: ""Any inability to operate in London, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, would adversely affect our business, revenue, and operating results. ""We cannot predict whether the TfL decision, or future regulatory decisions or legislation in other jurisdictions, may embolden or encourage other authorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an existing licence or permit."" In May, hundreds of Uber drivers in London, Birmingham, Nottingham and Glasgow staged a protest against the firm over pay and conditions Business lobby group the CBI said customers valued Uber, and encouraged both sides to find a resolution. But the Unite union - which believes Uber has unfairly taken business from black cab drivers - welcomed the news. ""Uber's DNA is about driving down standards and creating a race to the bottom which is not in the best interests of professional drivers or customers,"" said Jim Kelly, chair of Unite's London and Eastern cab section. Uber has faced pressure from regulators around the world over the way it treats its drivers, competition concerns, and fears about passenger safety. The US firmpulled out of Denmarkin 2017 because of new taxi laws that required drivers to have fare meters and seat sensors. Bulgaria and Hungary both stripped Uber's right to operate following pressure from local taxi unions. And in May, the ride-hailing firm pulled its UberXL service in Turkey without saying why. TfL first declined to renew Uber's licence in September 2017, again over safety concerns. Back then it cited Uber's approach to carrying out background checks on drivers and reporting serious criminal offences. Uber's use of secret software, called ""Greyball"", which could be used to block regulators from monitoring the app, was another factor, although Uber said it had never been used in the UK. However, TfL granted Uber a 15-month licence extension - later extended by two months - conditional on it making improvements to its business. TfL can offer licences of up to five years, but it has been more stringent of late. In July, Indian ride-hailing company Ola got a 15-month agreement for its entry into the London market, while ViaVan got a three-year licence renewal. Uber: Will it get its London licence back?

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said an “inadequate safety culture” at Uber was also a major contributing factor. As too were poor, or in some cases non-existent, rules governing firms testing self-driving technology. The findings follow a near two-year investigation. In a hearing to discuss the results, the NTSB urged national regulators to create a more thorough review process before the technology can be used on public roads. Elaine Herzberg, 49, was killed when an Uber-owned self-driving car - operating in autonomous mode - struck her as she crossed a road in Tempe, Arizona, on 18 March 2018. In the car was safety driver Rafaela Vasquez who, according to investigators, had been streaming a TV show on her mobile phone while behind the wheel. Dashcam footage showed Ms Vasquez spent 36% of the journey that evening looking at the device. In its experiments with driverless cars, Uber has mandated that a human operator pays attention at all times so they can take over in difficult situations or when the vehicle encounters a situation it does not know how to handle. Uber crash driver was 'watching TV' Self-driving Uber in fatal crash had 'safety flaws' ""Had the vehicle operator been attentive, she would likely have had sufficient time to detect and react to the crossing pedestrian to avoid the crash or mitigate the impact,"" the NTSB ruled. Uber’s computers detected Ms Herzberg 5.6 seconds before impact, the NTSB said, but did not correctly identify her as a person. The NTSB mapped the incident - yellow rings show metres ahead of the vehicle, orange lines centre of mapped travel and purple area the car's path The report said Ms Herzberg was acting unsafely in attempting to cross the road where she did - investigators said toxicology reports suggested she had taken drugs that may have impaired her judgement. Nevertheless, the NTSB said Uber had an ""inadequate safety culture, exhibited by a lack of risk assessment mechanisms, of oversight of vehicle operators, and of personnel with backgrounds in safety management”. It acknowledged on Tuesday that the company had made significant changes since the accident. Uber said it welcomed the recommendations. ""We deeply regret the March 2018 crash that resulted in the loss of Elaine Herzberg’s life, and we remain committed to improving the safety of our self-driving program,” said Nat Beuse, head of safety at Uber’s advanced technologies group. “Over the last 20 months, we have provided the NTSB with complete access to information about our technology and the developments we have made since the crash.

The impending decision has revived debate over whether the data-driven basis for its business model and the ""gig economy"" jobs it creates are fair. A wave of platforms has followed, offering new ways to buy and sell, to rent from and temporarily hire others. Rather than salaried employees, independent contractors are paid by consumers for a specific job - a ""gig"". The platforms in the middle argue they do not employ staff but simply connect customers with people seeking to make money. Research by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) estimates that one in 10 workers in the UK now regularly does ""platform work"". No company is more symbolic of this shift than Uber itself. As a consequence, it has become a lightning rod for arguments about what gig work really represents. Does it usher in new, flexible, liberating ways to work, or is it the means for a kind of arms-length control that undermines basic rights? Abdura Hadi, an Uber driver who has worked on the streets of London for five years, has noticed a change. Mr Hadi relies for work on Uber's job-allocation algorithm but says he is does not know how it works ""On average, I used to work six-to-eight hours, six days a week to provide for my family"" he told me. Now, he adds: ""It's 10-to-12 hours."" He's noticed that over the period, the number of Uber drivers has rapidly increased, while the number of pick-up jobs has not kept up. Increased competition has made a particular part of Uber's platform critical to Mr Hadi and his fellow drivers' earning power - the software that determines who gets each ride. However, none of them knows how it works. ""My family depends on the algorithm,"" he explains. ""Sometimes it's scary, but if it was fair, it would be OK."" At the heart of the controversy around Uber is that the disruption it has brought isn't just economic, but also legal. Uber: Will it get its London licence back? On the Record: TaskRabbit's Stacy Brown-Philpot The dangerous life of food delivery drivers Definitions that were once reasonably clear in the workplace have become muddied. The question of whether Uber drivers are actually employees is currently making its way through the British courts. Even one of the most basic facts of any job has become disputed: how much Uber drivers actually earn. ""It's a fact that drivers are working on less than minimum wage,"" claims Mr Hadi. Yet a recent study co-authored by researchers at Oxford University and Uber, based on administrative data from the company, reported that the median London driver earns about £11 per hour spent logged into the app. That is just above the London Living Wage. The study included vehicle operation costs and time spent waiting between rides while logged in. Ken Jacobs, an academic at University of California, Berkeley, who has studied hidden costs that Uber drivers and other gig workers face, refers to them as the five ""major loopholes"". They include: time spent waiting for rides the cost of driving back into busy areas after a ride vehicle maintenance and insurance the lack of payment for sick leave, meal breaks and rest breaks the lack of holiday pay ""They tend to way underestimate the actual expenses a driver incurs,"" he said. Meera Joshi, the former head of the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission, the regulator responsible for services like Uber across the city, says data is key. ""Without data you only have anecdotes,"" she told me. Uber was forced to pay drivers in New York more money ""You have stories from drivers about low wages, but you have no way to really quantify that."" In perhaps the first move of its kind, Ms Joshi's commission forced Uber to hand over data about its drivers operating in New York. ""What we found out was that conditions were worse than what was described to us by drivers,"" she said. ""Ninety-six per cent of drivers were making less than the city's minimum wage. Most of the drivers were providing the main source of income for their families."" After the watchdog implemented minimum-wage protections to cover the 80,000 New York drivers involved, an additional $225m (£172m) per month went ""back into the pockets of drivers"", said Ms Joshi. As a result, the cash flowed into local neighbourhoods rather than back to San Francisco-based Uber. The Oxford paper also claimed that Uber drivers had higher levels of life satisfaction than other workers, but also higher anxiety levels. ""That's the paradox of Uber,"" commented Duncan McCann, a researcher at the New Economics Foundation. ""It is both a prison and a liberator. You can just switch on the app and start working, but if you have a family to support, it's obviously less flexible. You need to match peaks of demand: rush hours and weekends."" And Uber is just the ""tip of the iceberg"", he added. ""The majority of gig-economy workers are women, doing care, cleaning. ""Under the water level, you have platforms openly advertising rates beneath minimum wage."" Uber has taken steps to benefit the drivers ahead of the licensing deadline. For example, last week it added a button to their app to let them report racism or other discriminatory behaviour from passengers, who it promises to kick off its platform if the complaint is upheld. ""Drivers are at the heart of our service - we can't succeed without them - and thousands of people come into work at Uber every day focused on how to make their experience better, on and off the road,"" it said in a statement. ""Whether it's being able to track your earnings or stronger insurance protections, we'll continue working to improve the experience for and with drivers."" But in many ways, the gig economy simply reintroduces very old issues of conditions and rights in the workplace in new ways. Previous decades saw the struggles of employees to have their rights recognised; now the struggle is one of workers to be recognised as employees at all. Once the focus was on the power of the owners of the means of production; now it is on the owners of the means to find work via the net. The new battleground is not over who controls the shop floor, but who controls the data involved. Who has it, and what it reveals. Whatever happens on 24 November, the wider debate will continue for a long time yet. Uber: Will it get its London licence back?..."

Pressed on Saudi links with Uber in a TV interview, Dara Khosrowshahi said: ""People make mistakes, it doesn't mean they can never be forgiven."" He later said the comments were wrong. Khashoggi - a US resident and prominent Saudi critic - was killed in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate last year. Saudi Arabia is Uber's fifth-largest shareholder and the head of its sovereign wealth fund is also on the company's board of directors. Mr Khosrowshahi made the remarks duringa discussion about Saudi Arabia's involvement in Khashoggi's murder,externalas part of the series Axios on HBO. When pressed on whether a representative from Saudi Arabia should remain on Uber's board, he said: ""I think that government said that they made a mistake."" He went on: ""It's a serious mistake, we've made mistakes too, right, with self-driving and we stopped driving and we're recovering from that mistake."" He was referring toUber's self-driving cars, one of which struck and killed a womanin 2018 when it ""failed"" to identify her as a pedestrian. Allow Twitter content?

Uber: The scandals that drove Travis Kalanick out Dara Khosrowshahi confirmed as Uber's new boss What happened to Jamal Khashoggi? Mr Khosrowshahi was appointed CEO in 2017, after former chief executive Travis Kalanick resigned amid pressure from shareholders. Mr Kalanick, Uber's billionaire co-founder, resigned after a spate of controversies at the firm. Issues included complaints from employees about a sexist and macho company culture and that accusations of sexual harassment were not taken seriously. He remains a member of the board of directors. On 2 October 2018, Khashoggi entered the Saudi Arabia consulate in Istanbul, where he was murdered. Conflicting narratives emerged after his death over how he died and who was responsible. Saudi officials claimed he was murdered in a ""rogue operation"" carried about by a team of agents, while others - including Turkish officials and the CIA - said the agents acted on orders from the highest levels of the Saudi government, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Elaine Herzberg, 49, was hit by the car as she was crossing a road in Tempe, Arizona. The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found the car failed to identify her properly as a pedestrian. The detailed findings raised a series of safety issues but did not determine the probable cause of the accident. The safety board is expected to make that finding when it meets on 19 November. The findings, released on Tuesday, may also be used to help shape recommendations for the developing autonomous driving industry. The sector has come under sharp scrutiny in the wake of the accident. The fatal crash occurred in March 2018, and involved a Volvo XC90 that Uber had been using to test its self-driving technology. Just before the crash, Ms Herzberg had been walking with a bicycle across a poorly lit stretch of a multi-lane road. Uber 'not criminally liable' for car death Uber crash driver was 'watching TV' Uber warned about self-drive car crashes According to the NTSB, Uber's test vehicle failed to correctly identify the bicycle as an imminent collision until just before impact. By that time, it was too late for the vehicle to avoid the crash. ""The system design did not include a consideration for jaywalking pedestrians,"" the NTSB said. This video can not be played Uber dashcam footage shows moment before fatal impact The report also said there were 37 crashes of Uber vehicles in self-driving mode between September 2016 and March 2018. In a statement, Uber said: ""We deeply value the thoroughness of the NTSB's investigation into the crash and look forward to reviewing their recommendations"". Earlier this year, prosecutors ruled that the company is not criminally liable for the death of Ms Herzberg. However, the car's back-up driver could still face criminal charges. Dash-cam footage released by police after the incident appeared to show the vehicle's back-up driver, Rafaela Vasquez, taking her eyes off the road moments before the accident. Further records from the streaming service Hulu suggested that Ms Vasquez had been streaming a television talent show on a phone at the time of the crash. Following the crash, authorities in Arizona suspended Uber's ability to test self-driving cars on the state's public roads. The company subsequently pulled the plug on its autonomous car operation in Arizona, although the company later resumed tests in Pennsylvania Uber 'not criminally liable' for car death Uber crash driver was 'watching TV' Who is to blame for 'self-driving car' deaths?..."
BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber launches job app for gig economy workers,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49917762,,"Uber is testing new ground with an app to put casual workers in touch with employers, as it faces an increasingly tough climate for its core ride-hailing business. Uber Works will allow cleaners, bar staff and warehouse workers to compare pay rates and sign up for shifts. The app, which launches on Friday, will initially only be available in Chicago. It will compete with a range of rival apps in the US market including Wonolo, Workpop and Shiftgig. The move comes as several parts of the world tighten regulation around Uber's operations as a ride-hailing firm.California recently passed legislationdesigned to pave the way for so-called “gig workers” to become employees and gain additional rights, which is expected to increase costs for firms such as Uber. Millions of American workers use staffing agencies, Ubersaid in a blog post,externalannouncing the venture. But it believes the process can be made more transparent and faster for both employees and firms. The app will provide information on pay, location and working conditions. Workers can also use it to track working hours and breaks, the firm said. Employers would be able to tap into a ready pool of ""vetted and qualified"" temporary labour, Uber said. Uber says 'gig economy' law will not hurt business On the Record: Stacy Brown-Philpot, TaskRabbit Uber's London licence renewed for two months Uber will focus on making the app successful in Chicago, where it has already operated in a test phase for the past year, before introducing it elsewhere, it added. The growth of casual hiring, dubbed the ""gig economy"", has been controversial. Some staff hired on an ad hoc basis say they appreciate the flexibility it offers, while others suffer income insecurity and a lack of other welfare benefits of employee status. Drivers working for Uber's original ride-hailing business have taken the company to court to establish the firm's duty to provide staff benefits such as holiday pay and sickness cover. Uber Works has agreed partnerships with staffing agencies in Chicago that employ, pay and handle worker benefits, potentially side-stepping this issue with the new platform.

The firm lost its licence in 2017 due to public safety concerns, after which a judge granted a 15-month extension which was due to expire on Wednesday. Transport for London (TfL) said its licence would now be renewed temporarily while it requested additional information from the firm. Uber must also meet new conditions on passenger safety, it said. It means the ride-sharing firm must wait until November to find out if it will be granted another full five-year licence. If it is not, it may have to stop trading in London, its most important European market. Uber has faced push-back from regulators and traditional taxi services in a number of countries after beingdogged by controversyfor a number of years. What do drivers think of Uber? Uber shares tumble as profit figures disappoint In London, TfL rejected Uber's licence renewal request in 2017, due to failings in the firm's approach to reporting serious criminal offences and driver background checks. Jamie Heywood, Uber's regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe, said on Tuesday that Uber would ""continue to work closely with TfL and provide any additional requested information"". He added: ""Over the past two years, we've launched a range of new safety features in the app, introduced better protections for drivers and our clean air plan is helping to tackle air pollution."" About 45,000 drivers work for Uber in London, and if its licence is ultimately rejected all of them could lose their jobs. The GMB union, which represents Uber drivers, said the firm has had ""more chances than a game of monopoly"". Regional officer Steve Garelick said: ""A two month licence extension is no good for anyone - it leaves uncertainty for drivers and passengers, meanwhile Uber still operates an unsafe model on the streets of London. ""Transport for London has simply kicked the can down the road and shown no regard for drivers or public safety."" Last year, a judge granted Uber a probationary 15-month licence to operate in London after the firm said it had made changes to its business model. But TfL said the new two-month licence would come with ""new conditions to ensure passenger safety"", covering things like insurance and driver document checks. It added: ""Uber London Limited has been granted a two-month private hire operator licence to allow for scrutiny of additional information that we are requesting ahead of consideration of any potential further licensing application.""

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber: Will it get its London licence back?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49773779,,"Taxi booking firm Uber will soon hear whether its licence to operate in London will be renewed, and if so, by how long. As things stand, its private hire licence will expire on Wednesday. Transport for London (TfL) will decide whether to award another licence, which can be for up to five years. The company lost its licence in 2017 over public safety concerns, after which a judge granted a 15-month extension which is due to end. TfL will probably announce its decision before Wednesday's deadline. There are three possible options: It could grant Uber a five-year licence It could offer a shorter agreement with conditions attached It could decline the company the right to operate. If TfL does decide against allowing the company to operate, Uber has 21 days to appeal against TfL's decision and can continue to operate while any appeals are continuing. A five-year agreement is unlikely, says Richard Kramer, an analyst at Arete Research. ""TfL likely wants to preserve leverage over companies to review their compliance on the many problems at Uber,"" he said. Recent licences have also been shorter than the five-year maximum, he said. In July, Indian ride-hailing company Ola got a 15-month agreement for its entry into the London market, while ViaVan got a three-year licence renewal. In September 2017, TfL said it declined to renew the licence on the grounds of ""public safety and security implications"". TfL's concerns included Uber's approach to carrying out background checks on drivers and reporting serious criminal offences. The UK is a top market for Uber Uber's use of secret software, called ""Greyball"", which could be used to block regulators from gaining full access to the app, was another factor, according to TfL. At the time, Uber rejected TfL's claims that it endangered public safety and said Greyball had never been used in the UK for the purposes cited by TfL. The company says it has made ""wholesale"" changes to the business since the licence loss. It now reports crimes directly to the police instead of logging criminal complaints with TfL, which caused delays. Among other changes, drivers can now only use the app in the region in which they hold a private hire licence, while their working hours are more tightly regulated. A licensed driver on the app has to now take an uninterrupted six-hour break after 10 hours of taking passengers or travelling to pick them up. The firm also made changes to its app in London to ""make it clearer"" to passengers that its drivers are licensed by TfL and that it accepts ride requests before allocating drivers. It has also hired a new chairman of the UK business, former Bank of England advisor Laurel Powers-Freeling, described as ""impressive"" by Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot  in her ruling approving Uber's extension. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan backed TfL's decision not to renew Uber's licence to operate in the capital in 2017 James Farrar, chair of the United Private Hire Drivers branch of the IWGB union, says he's not in favour of the company losing its licence, but he would like it to pay its workers more and share data with TfL to show what is being paid after expenses to keep wages above the minimum. ""The problem here has always been the failure to regulate,"" he said. The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commissionset a minimum hourly wage,externalafter expenses of $17.22 (£13.80) for drivers last year. Mr Farrar said a similar rule in London would protect drivers' wages, and he would like Mayor Sadiq Khan to intervene. A questionput last week to Mr Khan about the licence renewal,externalis still awaiting a reply, according to the London Authority's website. Both Uber and TfL declined to comment ahead of the decision. ""Uber continues to lose share to Lyft in the US, faces the threat of further labour regulation which could bring rising driver costs in many markets and has limited scope for increasing the percentage it takes of the fare further after already making significant changes to charge riders more and pay drivers less,"" said Arete Research's Mr Kramer. ""As a business, burning cash but with slowing growth, it faces more challenges than just its licence in London, which is a top five market for them."" Uber's losses widened to $5.2bn in the three months to 30 June, from $878m in the quarter last year.  Total revenue rose 14.4% to $3.2bn, but fell short of average analysts' estimates of $3.4bn. Uber's costs rose 147% to $8.7bn in the quarter, including a sharp rise in spending for research and development. The company floated on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year and its shares have lost about a quarter of their value since then. Uber, which admitted ahead of its Wall Street listing that it may never make a profit, is trying to convince investors that growth will come not only from its ride services, but also from other logistics and food delivery services.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber says 'gig economy' law will not hurt business,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-49670849,,"Gig economy workers are demanding more representation Uber has insisted a new Californian law will not force it to change how it treats its drivers. Lawmakers passed Assembly Bill 5 (AB5) on Tuesday, a move designed to pave the way for so-called “gig workers” to become employees and gain additional rights. But Uber told reporters,externalit “strongly believed” it met the new law’s requirements for legally classifying workers as “contractors” instead. Nevertheless, the firm said it had, along with rival ride-sharing service Lyft, invested $60m (£49m) in campaigning for alternative measures to be introduced. Uber said in a conference call on Wednesday it was prepared to spend more, and had hired the “best campaign team available”. AB5 passed California's Senate 92 votes to 11 late on Tuesday night, and is expected to be signed into law by state governor Gavin Newsom imminently. The bill could have big implications not just for rideshare firms, but other app-based services offering “gigs” to workers, such as DoorDash and Postmates. Shirked responsibility In an opinion piece for the Sacramento Bee newspaper earlier this month,external, Governor Newsom endorsed the bill, saying companies such as Uber - today valued at $56bn - were abusing employment law and making working people worse off. “Workers lose basic protections like the minimum wage, paid sick days and health insurance benefits,” he wrote. “Employers shirk responsibility to safety net programs like workers’ compensation and unemployment insurance. Taxpayers are left to foot the bill.” AB5 demands that workers be considered employees unless companies can prove the worker is “free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work”. Critics of gig economy firms say app-based work - which assigns jobs and attaches a rate of pay - mean workers are not “free from control”. The companies, however, argue that because workers can determine when they work, where they work and for how long, they are “free”. AB5 will force Uber and other firms like it to go through what’s known as the ABC test, which assesses the question of whether or not companies can consider their workers contractors rather than employees. “Just because the test is hard doesn’t mean that we will not be able to pass it,” said Tony West, Uber’s top lawyer, on Wednesday. Limiting flexibilty The firm’s confidence will likely be tested when AB5 comes into force on 1 January 2020. Under the law, cities in California can sue Uber (or other gig-economy firms) directly if they feel the firm is not complying - previously it was up to individual drivers. Analysts have predicted devastating consequences for gig economy firms’ bottom line if they are forced to reclassify workers into employees. When asked, Uber would not offer any guidance to investors over how damaging such a change would be. The firm lost just over $5.2bn in its last reported quarter. Lyft, valued at $15bn, lost $2.3bn in the same period. The companies warned they would look to implement more traditional work patterns. “Flexibility of drivers would be limited,” Uber’s Mr West said. “Drivers would not be able to choose to sign on when they wanted. Not only would they have to work shifts, they would be deployed to areas, rather than choosing where to pick up a fare.” He added: “Based on what drivers tell us, they are not changes they would welcome.” This video can not be played Uber drivers in Nairobi explain why they are going on strike Instead, Uber - along with Lyft - has proposed drafting alternative legislation as a compromise. It would guarantee a minimum wage of $21 per hour, and offer the chance for sectoral collective bargaining, allowing workers across the rideshare industry to band together in negotiations. The compromise, yet to be drafted, does not look likely to sway California’s lawmakers. “Billionaires who say they can’t pay minimum wages to their workers say they will spend tens of millions to avoid labour laws,” Ms Gonzalez wrote on Twitter last week. “Just pay your damn workers!” she added. _____ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

Anthony Levandowski was charged with 33 counts of trade theft involving Alphabet's self-driving car technology. He had left Alphabet's Waymo unit in 2016 and eventually ran Uber's self-driving car project, only to be fired. The 39-year-old, who now runs his own firm, denies the charges. ""Not a single one of these supposedly secret files ever went to Uber or to any other company or person,"" said Miles Ehrlich, a lawyer for Mr Levandowski. Waymo and Uber were involved in a protracted lawsuit, which the taxi company eventually settled in 2018. Mr Levandowski was not party to that case, and did not publicly comment on the allegations. The claim is that before leaving Waymo, Mr Levandowski downloaded thousands of files in 2015 related to Alphabet's self-driving car technology, including details related to Lidar, a crucial sensor technology for self-driving cars. ""All of us have the right to change jobs, none of us has the right to fill our pockets on the way out the door,"" Californian federal prosecutor David Anderson said. ""Theft is not innovation.""

""If we said that we were going to an unauthorised protest it would have provided good evidence for the police to charge us,"" said KK, an office worker and protester in his late 20s, who asked for his identity to be protected. Thousands of protesters gathered at the location, recognising that the video game - which lets players pit virtual monsters against each other at real-world locations - had been used as a way to gather people together for a very different kind of battle. Crowds were eventually dispersed with tear gas as police and protesters clashed into the late evening. ""Many people think of creative ways to gather people,"" KK added. ""We will occasionally 'play' Pokemon Go, or take part in 'Bible reading groups' or 'history tours'."" Mass demonstrations against a now-suspended extradition bill started in Hong Kong in the spring. Among the protesters' demands are amnesty for anyone arrested during the demonstrations and greater choice in future elections held in the semi-autonomous city. And they are are finding increasingly creative ways to organise and stage their rallies. Maps promoting Pokemon Go events serve as a way to flag where protests will be held From chats on the private messaging app Telegram to Uber's ride-hailing service, apps have become an integral part of the way that Hong Kong's youth-led movement is organised. On packed subways, protesters anonymously send freshly-designed posters via Apple's wi-fi and Bluetooth-based file-transfer facility AirDrop - to share times and locations. ""At the very early stage of the movement, Telegram was mostly used to spread information to protesters,"" said Rob, a university graduate and active protester in his 20s. ""Information typically included real-time locations of the police force, the situations at different front lines on different streets and locations of first aid stations, gas masks, goggles, bottles of water."" Now, he explained, it is frequently used to place orders for Uber pick-ups. The drivers disable their GPS (global positioning system) receivers to avoid being tracked as they offer rides home to protesters who need to leave the scene. This online poster calls for Uber volunteers to pick up protesters trapped at one demo ""Volunteer drivers now submit their location, destination and licence number to the admin of the [relevant Telegram] channel,"" says Rob. ""Protesters can see from the real-time map - Uber drivers at the same location usually means pick-up points... to get away.""

Rob specialises in putting out tear gas canisters fired by the police. KK believes that the use of apps is key to the ""leaderless nature"" of the movement. Since early June, police have arrested more than 500 protesters. The demonstrators say using online tools - which help them protect their anonymity - has helped avoid individuals being targeted. ""All of the people in the Umbrella Movement were jailed for inciting people to protest, now people tend not to be so open about encouraging people to protest,"" KK says, referencing the 2014 pro-democracy protests and subsequent imprisonment of their leaders.

BBC,0.05855610077732243,Uber shares tumble as profit figures disappoint Wall Street,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49287489,,"Uber's shares went into reverse on Thursday after the taxi-hailing company unveiled profit figures that failed to live up to expectations. Revenue growth slowed in face of heavy competition, leading to the company posting its largest quarterly loss. Uber and its rivals are spending heavily to expand, but boss Dara Khosrowshahi said that the competitive pressures are easing. But that didn't stop Uber's share price tumbling 13% in after-hours trading. Is Uber really worth billions of dollars? Uber planning stock market flotation 'in April' Would you buy shares in Uber? On Wednesday, rival Lyft reported figures that were generally welcomed on Wall Street, and there was an expectation that Uber would also post positive numbers. But Uber's loss widened to $5.2bn (£4.3bn) in the three months to 30 June, from $878m in the quarter last year. The figures reflected $3.9bn of share-based compensation expenses related to its stock market listing earlier this year. Total revenue rose 14.4% to $3.2bn, but fell short of average analysts' estimates of $3.4bn. Uber's costs rose 147% to $8.7bn in the quarter, including a sharp rise in spending for research and development. Mr Khosrowshahi said the competitive environment is starting to rationalise and had been ""progressively improving"" since the first quarter. While the company continues to invest aggressively, it is expected to spend less on promotions and incentives to win market share. Uber and Lyft have historically relied on subsidies to attract riders, and have been spending heavily to expand into areas such as self-driving technology and food delivery. Uber, which admitted ahead of its Wall Street listing thatit may never make a profit, is trying to convince investors that growth will come not only from its ride services, but also from other logistics and food delivery services. Gross bookings, a measure of total value of rides before driver costs and other expenses, rose 31% from 2018 to $15.76bn, below analysts' forecasts of about $15.8bn. The number of monthly active users rose to 99 million globally, from 93 million at the end of the first quarter and 76 million a year earlier. ""Uber has turned into the magical money burning machine."" That's how Publicis Sapient analyst Alyssa Altman described Uber's second quarter results. The damning words go to the heart of the company's challenge: can Uber find a way to be profitable? Its latest set of results failed to assuage sceptical investors and they gave the stock the cold shoulder. It doesn't help that its rival, Lyft, suggested on Wednesday that it could achieve profitability sooner than expected. Traditionally Uber and Lyft have spent heavily on promotions to attract riders and win market share. Both companies have said that price pressure is easing. And yet Uber's costs still rose an astonishing 147%. The chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, is betting that future growth will come not just from ride services, but from other businesses like food delivery. The signs are that he has clearly not yet convinced investors. For Wall Street, these numbers on Thursday show this is still a company stuck in traffic. Why Uber drivers are striking in Nairobi.

Tees Valley Combined Authority said passengers will be able to determine the route by requesting pick-up and drop-off points within a defined area. It is hoped to improve transport links in the region's rural areas. Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said people in these areas ""are frequently left behind."" He said: ""We're driving cash into every part of our transport network, from upgrades to our major train stations, roads, and walking and cycling routes and an airport that's now in our control, but I can't nationalise buses. ""This Uber-style service is a great answer to get those people not served by other routes moving and where they need to be."" Passengers will be able order buses on the phone, via an app or through a website. They will also be able to select destinations such as hospitals that are outside of the service area. The system will then match-up with passengers travelling in the same direction and schedule vehicles to find the fastest route. Councillor Heather Scott, Combined Authority Cabinet lead for Transport, said: ""There's no point in us working hard to create jobs and training, or to improve our town centres and attractions if our residents can't access any of it. ""This scheme will help those who need it most benefit from the opportunities and changes we're bringing about."" The pilot is expected to start by the end of the year for a minimum of 3 years.
