I’m hearing that many Minneapolis 
@uber
 drivers are using fake IDs to drive for them. Nobody should be requesting #Uber in the Twin Cities area. It’s not safe. Please RT! #Rideshare

Took some profit on $UBER as it's in a zone where profit-taking occurred twice before, based on an average. The stock still looks strong, but this decision is purely based on a short-term move (1-hour chart).

Uber's CEO is setting up a robotaxi dance-off—even if Musk opts out, Waymo's stepping in with the moves.  
Bullish long-term vibes with a 30% rally mean #Uber ($UBER) is the life of the AV party.

If you buy groceries using 
@uber
 watch out for what looks like bait & switch/hidden fees under ""Subtotal Adjustment"". They charged me 18 CAD out of thin air & refused to provide me with an itemized invoice.

If I were a betting man, I’d pick the Philadelphia Eagles to take the win today with a final score of 28-27. 

But one thing I know for sure — DUI patrols will be in full effect tonight.
